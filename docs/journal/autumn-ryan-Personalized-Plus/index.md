- Your device ugprades may be enrolling you in the "Personalized Plus" program, contrary to your or any agent knowledge of the program.
- This program overrides customer CPNI consent choices, and is tooled explicitly to operate "regardless of your state".
- This program supercedes but includes participation in the "Personalized" program, which they disclose is illegal in the following states: CO, CT, DE, IA, IN, KY, MD, MN, MT, NE, NH, NJ, OR, TN, TX, UT, and VA.
- "Personalized Plus" re-enables the undisclosed sale and transfer of your personal details, precise location, browsing on and off their network, on and off of SSL, your "race or ethnic origin", your device identifiers, which apps you have installed, and more.
- AT&T discloses that they enrich this data with the data of third parties who build ad profiles on you.
- I believe a precise map of individuals by ethnicity is being sold by the company Placer Labs Inc, which operates as "placer.ai" and without geographical boundaries, and that they possess the data of all or most phone carrier networks and their reselling partners.
- Placer Labs believes their data must be fuzzed in some situations, lest it trivialize identification of individuals.
- The city of Fort Collins procured real-time location data services from Placer Labs Inc approximately one month after the AT&T's Terms and Conditions document for the "Personalized Plus" program was dated November 12, 2024.
- By August 20, AT&T employees be they retail, corporate and phone were universally unaware of the program.
- By August 23, phone agents found a script to use.
- Documentation has been compiled regarding the behavior of AT&T and its AI Agents on the subject of the program and whether it was even real.
