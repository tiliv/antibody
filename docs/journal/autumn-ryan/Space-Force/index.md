- leaving Colorado after a settled prior question about leaving the temporary hq in the state
- prior decisions were reportedly about costs not gaining anything at other sites
- the unitary executive has made Alabama the home now, substituting reason for heritage
- no doubt this administration has vision for what to do with it
- it is not just that there is new value measured, it is that plans from the unitary executive are not appraisable by any metric but the existing pre-decision
- though this executive has the Authority, written or awarded since, it is a continued sign of what has been observed already:
- democratic debate and independent reasoning are assets, but these are continuously replaced with company scrip with this executive's face on it
- processes are being captured already, beyond threatening to
- the charisma of this person is provided as truly global currency, and we surrender much
- i cast aspersions on the Alabama connection to the new home of Space Force;
- the state's leadership has shown the executive exceptional proactive ideas like Tuberville single-handedly blocking military appointments in general protest of abortion the idea
- Alabama has shown its loyalty to the executive and has mostly stayed out of direct conversation since abortion the idea last triggered the leaders, and their coming reward has been implicit for some time

- the executive calls for their sanctuary
- political games motivating the unitary executive is no story
- the accelerating acceptance of them without a shred of debate are
- when we announced that these things are not normal, and others say back that it might actually be, they have redefined normal to be Possible
- rivers of process are being diverted from our federal systems so that those systems wilt without purposes, closed after it's clear to all
- that the executive can do this does not supplant conversation observing it on the way to deeper authoritarian capture
- rewriting the past is the only move America First knows, and they continue to prove they can do it by changing prior outcomes by decree alone
