Cori Wong draws a crowd on a Friday night. The parking is full in this area as people go off to do other things, but at the Visit Fort Collins center, Cori is presenting her finale event at year's end, the 11th in a series called _For The Love Of Strangers_.

She ran other events throughout the year. This wasn't a ticketed event, but she took donations.

I met Cori on November 3 at an entrepreneur social mixer event. I also ran into her at a local food market by a scheduling happenstance on my part. She remembered my name then, and remembered it when I walked into the venue tonight.

It was my first time attending one of her events, and I sat at a table with one other newbie like me and two returners.

### Meta

Thinking about thinking.

Writing about writing.

Love is a word we might assume a lot about.

#### Love Three Ways

1. Love, an Artist: Yours Truly
2. Love <- an artist: The WILL TO EXTEND oneself for the PURPOSE of nurturing one's own or another's HEALING, TRANSFORMATION, OR LIBERATION
3. Love Dynamics: Make and Hold Space for something (radically new) to emerge - an inherently Creative Practice

Over time, this idea developed out of a private birthday party. Stories like The Energetic Hug.

- Embodied Things
- Professional Business
- Connecting Across Difference
- Dating & Relation
- Parasocial Connecting
- Therapy
- Failure
- Sensual Stuff
- Parties and Communities

**Nick**: Parasocial isn't always bad. Finding joy in following artist, figuratively and also literally.

**Rich**: Dating and relationships, had a short relationship. Communication and leaning in.

Going outside your comfort zone, even worst ones inspire.

#### Love, an Artist

A meta-fiction newsletter that got dropped, but here we are talking about it anyway.

Failure isn't an ending.

Phi-life-sophy.

What if we got to know each other based on the way we want to be known?

What if we were Cuties who met each other by saying Who Are You, Beyond The Limitations Of Your World?

Introduce ourselves with our aspirational selves.

When we introduce ourselves, do we have A Branding Issue with ourselves?

Knowing ourselves so thoroughly that we met each other as if we were already free.

**Rich**: 30 years in marketing. Are we really free?

**Autumn**: There often aren't words, can't be communicated. Audience & interest is hard to ensure.

What do you wish you could say?

Hard to know if what we want to say is aspirational, permanent or shifting.

#### Make It A True Story

You have to do the insane steps to make it even possible for something to be true in the future.

**Rich**: Outlining 10 years, 5 years, 1 year, Now.

**Autumn**: I have to wake up to what I should have done yesterday. Zero steps. What do we do when we're by ourselves, without the affirmation of others?

**Jeff**: Do I have the authority? Stay in my lane?

> I'm in my Yes Man era.

Side character energy: be connective, add spice without needing to have fame or something like it.

#### Break Website Convention

Be about something they haven't seen before, something they have to engage with to comprehend.

The about page is not a common denominator, it's a sprawling tour of what might appeal.

Maybe the internet isn't forever. Maybe you have to work to keep the evidence of yourself close. You've been doing you for a long time.

**Autumn**: Know the rules to break the rules.

**Rich**: What if it's not a business?

**Autumn**: What if, indeed?

It's not possible to wrap up everything in an About page. Brutal minimalism. Understated. Let them discover based on the hook.

#### Want To Know

Or, how to develop an epistemology of intimacy.

Intimacy is a form of spiritual closeness.
