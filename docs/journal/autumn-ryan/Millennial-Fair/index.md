### Your Classmate Reunion

Violence blossomed in This Country. It came after Facebook took our attention, sold it and then paraded propagandas in our faces from people we didn't know.

Two Millennials have been prolifically murdered by the terrorist god-complex border patrol, far from the border that Texas and the Unitary Executive call an immigration warzone.

Millennials watched Texas, Florida and other Governors forcefully bus immigrants into the hearts of many states in This Country, and now the terrorists go chasing their own ball, and they'll kill anyone to be seen doing it. Sometimes you can spot the executioner forgetfully pulling his gun when his buddies expose a man in an execution pose they practiced.

Millennials are executed by Millennials. Your Classmates are being praised when they just shoot you ten times during a mockery peace-keeping tour.

Millennials see Our Country which suffered 9/11, a financial crisis, COVID and AI, and real estate is now claimed occupied by A Company, which is great news when the median home price is pressuring half a million USD.

Now Our Country is being staffed, every state one by one, with militarized terrorists in time to have infrastructure on election year.

We Millennials grew up in school together. Near me, this political difference amounted to angst about farming and fees. John Deere hadn't even stopped you from repairing your own equipment yet.

We Millennials, like many, heard that we would get more conservative as we aged and that what we thought was stupid.

We were raised in a world that does not function, while they claimed it does. The glowing failure light of every system is shrugged off with excuses that everyone on average is better off, so the lights don't really mean anything practical.

As Millennials, we have by and large not yet participated in our governments, but we are old enough to be wrestled up into an execution bow and shot over and over, to make sure we don't die loud and slow.

Our classmates are now issuing extrajudicial death penalties against us. Donald John Trump did not kill us. He got our classmates to kill us, for their own reasons.

The classmates of ours who successfully instigate a murder are given bonuses and commendations. The boys you once thought were just pointless rednecks are able to gun you down, and the only thing that changed was the arrival of the Unitary Executive.

They always wanted to kill you. It's why it happens at all. The Unitary Executive isn't picking targets. He's asking them to.

The instantaneous murder of Renee Good and the savage execution of bystander Alex Pretti stand as shocking examples of what Our Classmates will do to us.

You knew they were dangerous, you just didn't think they intended to maximize that danger.

Millennials, having largely been alive to brace for Y2K, have witnessed from beginning to end a government arm itself with a Department of Homeland Security and ICE, only to turn it on the interior to pay back with interest a perceived witch hunt.

Millennials have died by selection in busy streets, and the Unitary Executive insists this is because Those Domestic Terrorists killed Charlie Kirk.

A Mormon college boy shot a propagandist, and now we are executed in the streets by our classmates.

It doesn't make sense, not the macro scale.

Your Classmates bring with them biases and prejudices that they carried all along, and they are being asked to finally use those against Us, for any wildcard reason they have in their hand.

This is true because they can execute you for any reason, and if they are still new and unable to invent a cool story fast, the Department of Homeland Security is quick to a microphone to repeat the same line as last time as though it comes with Authority: This Was A Domestic Terrorist.

When your classmates kill you, they are being asked to call You a Domestic Terrorist. This places the authority to pick who they want to dance with, who they think fits their own view of Probably The Sort To Like Domestic Terrorists.

Donald John Trump was found to be a pedophile, and now he has Millennials killing each other and picking sides.

Border Patrol can and will corner an entire group in a store and execute them with overkill spray fire, and there will not be consequences.

Our SCOTUS drools, while we Millennials die For Nothing, protected by No Constitution, No Amendments, No Limit To Actions Called Official.

We will lose more. The Unitary Executive kings himself (not his station) at the top of a new world order he calls a Peace Board. On his right hand is Israel, who has successfully taught Americans that there is such a thing as a mind virus that lives in every civilian and cannot be reasoned with, and earns bullets and bombs because there's just no other way of dealing.

Israel, purveyor of spyware and mass murder, has taught This Country all it needs to know to begin a long term campaign to murder Millennials and younger generations, and call that the status quo.

### Recompense

The more of us they kill, the more safe they can claim the survivors are.

Their Thesis is that the world was already going wrong by the time you were kids together, and that These Boys are the ones who get to kill people for recompense.

Do you trust those idiot boys in middle school or high school with a gun and that job?

Capitalist systems grow evil in their hearts when nothing is allowed to observe, by competition or regulation. SCOTUS has allowed a Unitary Executive to flex all his power, and they hang on for him when he insists he's not done. The President cannot be Observed, and he may claim that your impromptu execution was Official Business.

The Unitary Executive stochastically begs for new executions, which are fielded instantly with hoax explanations.

The government leadership hacks are obviously that. Congress is held down and it whimpers as it often gives what was asked, sometimes only weeks before the mean master uses the money to hurt people just as promised.

You cannot reason with this administration. They have moved on to violence because they are done reasoning. Whether or not you think they were good at it, they believe they have entered the random execution phase of their plan.

What is Your Plan?

Your realtime location data is sold about and authorized by your forged consent.

A Warrant is not necessary to find anything in the pile of your data.

Federal police are liars

They want more executions livestreamed to the whole world so you do their marketing for them?

Do you stop them by handling their distribution pipeline?

Is that your limit?

They have proved that they do not care who you are. They going so deeply to their bully cores and deciding that anyone they hate deserves what comes next if they squirm.

The Heritage Foundation continues to whisper in the Unitary Executive's ear, promising plans for `Marriage Camps`.

**Meanwhile, the overlapping and sustained screams of children** are heard in the parking lot to the tender age facility in Dilley, TX.

They have demanded papers. Your bastard classmates actually demand papers now.

**You Should Know that there is not any paper you can carry which they cannot doubt.** You are being judged on other things, like what they see before they know your name or seen those papers.

Your Papers are irrelevant. Their lip service has been made, describing a punishment for the whole class.

When the terrorism parade comes to Colorado, the Governor will allow it. He is worthless while he contemplates how Tina Peters might be right. Governor Polis of Colorado is buying into fringe alt-woke doctrines that the justice system isn't suitable for an unapologetic mole against the public.

When the terrorism parade comes to Fort Collins, I worry that the police will allow it, understandably off put by Governor Polis not doing his job.

The truth is that the Colorado State Defense Force is not active, and could not be made active.

Governor Polis will easily allow the military death gangs known for their public executions.

Every next state which tolerates a sweeping military occupation and infrastructure establishment will be held up as model behavior, and any complaining they hear is the real problem.

Elections as you knew them are functionally over, Millennials.

The meaning of fairness eludes all of us for most of the time, but it is not Being Executed By Your Classmate `For Nothing`.

They claim their right to murder because `It's Time, Suddenly`.

Millennials should urgently seek office and claw real power to themselves. It is you they want dead, as many as will come, before mass murder of civilians proves they never needed the Insurrection Act.

ICE and Border Patrol have a combined function greater than any prison system or private military and does not answer to Congress.

The court police are also a federal government function, and they will be ineffective the day a court orders one of our ruling terrorists detained. The court is powerless, which the Executive branch knows full well when they lie to its judicial face with enthusiasm.

If the police, governor, mayor and militia are all powerless, what is it your right to do?
