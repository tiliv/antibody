### Unsolicited

- On the morning of October 16, I was contacted by an LLM with an unsolicited message.
- An LLM exactly like the First State Auto Group's Impel.ai
- Only this time it's hording my financial metadata and contact information from the outset, because EliseAI is their CRM.
- The CEO of EliseAI (previously: Meet Elise) proclaims that all multifamily housing operations in America should be offshored and centralized for her industry outsider efficiency kink.
  - [://antibody/journal/autumn-ryan/EliseAI-Hierarchy-of-Needs](/journal/autumn-ryan/EliseAI-Hierarchy-of-Needs)

- When I confronted the office staff (within actual minutes of the unsolicited LLM contact), they had an easier time pulling it up than First State Auto Group, and didn't struggle to identify the LLM's contact with me.
- They admit this one is called Elise.
- They want to know what my problem is, so that they can wave their hand and give an empty explanation.
- I asked who named it (as it tradition), and yet again, I have found that no one is capable of speaking about these Agents as anything other than a fully autonomous hoaxes of humanity.
  - It works this way precisely because the services are being sold to the property managers the exact same way: The entire point is to set and forget.
- When I supplied the questions I wanted to ask, she was not ready for how many, and how specific they were. I will have to provide my questions to her directly, because she did not write a faithful version down for her notes.
- She did not comprehend my issue with consent.
- These people are wholeheartedly convinced that ambushing you with an opt-in attack, and then being upset and opting out, is the gold standard for "consent".
- In a previous adventure, this property manager group put flyers on our doors for a business that does not even exist in our town. They sold us out within weeks of ownership transfer.
  - When I brought this past incident up, she intoned that it was unfair because they'd quit doing it.
  - As if we can't tell how much you disrespect our Privacy in the first place.
- I have moved across this country, and one hundred percent of my homes have been snatched up by these companies, no matter where I go, no matter who owns my unit.

- She seems to believe that because these software systems are national, that's an out for them at the personal level (???).
  - But this is exactly the problem I'm highlighting. She don't have half the control she feigns. And if she does, it's being weaponized for financial motives.
  - Oh, how all the cogs are so innocent, so so innocent.
- They have no tangible control over their rent software, other than to nudge prices within a range.
  - She no doubt believes me to be confused when I call what they do "patently offensive", as though I'm accusing them of doing an overtly illegal thing right this second.
  - The fevered rush to say it's legal is amusing: yes, yes it is, and you are weaponizing it against us all.
- When she tried to eject the conversation into "it's a state issue", I was more than happy to tell her I'm working to meet state leadership, including the running candidate Phil Weiser for Governor of Colorado. Presently, he is AG, and is doing small group sessions in NoCo before year's end.
- When I asked if she knew whether the group which owns us is actively looking for more properties (since they didn't own us until just a few months ago either), there was zero coherent reply.
  - Surely buying more properties is profitable, right?
  - Riiiight?
  - Who Is Next?
- When I pressed to know if she knew of other properties which were NOT at risk of being bought up by our masters, she replied: "Anywhere but here."
  - In awe, I just left.

- I spent an hour walking around the property talking to my fellow residents, just enjoying some conversation. Who knows if we talked about EliseAI. Who knows.

This must end, Your insatiable capture of Our Homes the whole nation over with a multinational PropTech cartel. You drive up our prices without remorse so that You can spend Your Capital on Hoaxes to run against us, and then feign Your Helplessness while You Enrich Yourselves and the AI vendors who intend for Your Financial Destruction too.

**You Sold Us With Enthusiasm.**

**For what? So that you don't have to do Your Job?**

**You won't have a job, once these Agents are through with you.** Even Minna Song thinks so. She doesn't even come from this industry. She thinks My Home is a Product for her and you to wield against me on a compounding basis, and intends to release predictive algorithms that let you gouge me appropriately when it detects that you have broken me into leaving.

**And You Love Vacancies. Time to turn the price up even higher.**

**Minna Song intends to centralize all of America's multifamily housing operations offshore**, And Then Bleed Us Forever having gotten You to pay them for the opportunity, with Our Money You Seized With Rent Software.

**I will make You illegal.**

I have scheduled both a live demo with EliseAI, and a return meeting with the property management.

#### Questions

Given that this LLM is fundamentally unknown to all residents and does not expressly identify its nature when it instigates contact autonomously, my questions are these:

1. On what date was my personally identifiable information (PII) first given to the LLM?
2. At what frequency does the LLM receive updates to our PII?
  - If the LLM is the source of truth and does not need async updates, that's important to know.
3. Why did the LLM initiate contact with me? What _exactly_ instigated this contact?
4. What decision-making powers are enumerated for the LLM?
5. Can the LLM make decisions without your foreknowledge?
6. What does your database schema allow you to track about me?
7. Have you read the EliseAI Privacy Policy?
8. Who makes digital service purchases for the property?
9. If EliseAI suffers a data breach, what is your responsibility to protect my privacy, if any?
10. Can EliseAI resell derivative metadata about me to its own partners?
11. Where are you most likely to work after they fire you for being less efficient than an LLM?
12. Can EliseAI retain all of my PII after I am no longer financially obligated to you?

### Followup

- At the return visit, the human agent of Brookfield Properties listened to the questions recorded below. I skipped only the one about where they'll work after they lose their jobs.
- The human agent failed to record any of these, and latently tried to summarize my questions as a request for which triggers allow the LLM hoax to decide to contact me. This damaged summary was performed because they felt the other questions were being addressed then, in situ. This was not the case: The human agent's answers were all I-Don't-Knows or improvised conjecture.

#### Request Cannot Be Completed

  caption='This introduction to their identify verification platform completely disconnects me from what they already know about me. They are fundamentally evading the premise of my request by making me go through some other portal they could send anyone to. My letter is scarcely relevant.'

- On October 30 2025, the legal team representing Brookfield Properties with an address in Ontario Canada sent me a receipt of my request, some 14 days after their human agent received it.
- The link they provided to "verify" my identity for proof of which state I live in (How could I live anywhere but the property they sell me?) was a broken link that led to an HTTP 404.
- The wording of their receipt acknowledgement made it highly ambiguous whether they considered October 16 or 30 as the receipt date.
- I issued a second signed document requesting they attest to the date, and whether their human agent was in fact an agent representing them.
- They did not acknowledge my second letter directly, but improperly quoted from it the sabotaged date of October 17, instead of 16.
- They are freestyling without verifying their own obligations.
- They issued a new link.
- The new link was a quiz with no notice of time limits, but on a particularly egregious question about which other states some random person from my extended family owns property (??), I paused the quiz to receive a phone call.
- I returned to the quiz to find that I was locked out, having "failed" my verification. The platform emailed me confirmation that my data privacy request would not be honored.

- At no point is a human's name visible in this process. All emails exchanged on the platform are from concealed identities, while they try to harass mine.
- I wrote back to condescend and I demanded that they reset the process, and not to test me lest I swing at them harder.
