### Unsolicited

- On the morning of October 16, I was contacted by an LLM with an unsolicited message.
- An LLM exactly like the First State Auto Group's Impel.ai
- Only this time it's hording my financial metadata and contact information from the outset, because EliseAI is their CRM.
- The CEO of EliseAI (previously: Meet Elise) proclaims that all multifamily housing operations in America should be offshored and centralized for her industry outsider efficiency kink.
  - [://antibody/journal/autumn-ryan/EliseAI-Hierarchy-of-Needs](/journal/autumn-ryan/EliseAI-Hierarchy-of-Needs)

- When I confronted the office staff (within actual minutes of the unsolicited LLM contact), they had an easier time pulling it up than First State Auto Group, and didn't struggle to identify the LLM's contact with me.
- They admit this one is called Elise.
- They want to know what my problem is, so that they can wave their hand and give an empty explanation.
- I asked who named it (as it tradition), and yet again, I have found that no one is capable of speaking about these Agents as anything other than a fully autonomous hoaxes of humanity.
  - It works this way precisely because the services are being sold to the property managers the exact same way: The entire point is to set and forget.
- When I supplied the questions I wanted to ask, she was not ready for how many, and how specific they were. I will have to provide my questions to her directly, because she did not write a faithful version down for her notes.
- She did not comprehend my issue with consent.
- These people are wholeheartedly convinced that ambushing you with an opt-in attack, and then being upset and opting out, is the gold standard for "consent".
- In a previous adventure, this property manager group put flyers on our doors for a business that does not even exist in our town. They sold us out within weeks of ownership transfer.
  - When I brought this past incident up, she intoned that it was unfair because they'd quit doing it.
  - As if we can't tell how much you disrespect our Privacy in the first place.
- I have moved across this country, and one hundred percent of my homes have been snatched up by these companies, no matter where I go, no matter who owns my unit.

- She seems to believe that because these software systems are national, that's an out for them at the personal level (???).
  - But this is exactly the problem I'm highlighting. She don't have half the control she feigns. And if she does, it's being weaponized for financial motives.
  - Oh, how all the cogs are so innocent, so so innocent.
- They have no tangible control over their rent software, other than to nudge prices within a range.
  - She no doubt believes me to be confused when I call what they do "patently offensive", as though I'm accusing them of doing an overtly illegal thing right this second.
  - The fevered rush to say it's legal is amusing: yes, yes it is, and you are weaponizing it against us all.
- When she tried to eject the conversation into "it's a state issue", I was more than happy to tell her I'm working to meet state leadership, including the running candidate Phil Weiser for Governor of Colorado. Presently, he is AG, and is doing small group sessions in NoCo before year's end.
- When I asked if she knew whether the group which owns us is actively looking for more properties (since they didn't own us until just a few months ago either), there was zero coherent reply.
  - Surely buying more properties is profitable, right?
  - Riiiight?
  - Who Is Next?
- When I pressed to know if she knew of other properties which were NOT at risk of being bought up by our masters, she replied: "Anywhere but here."
  - In awe, I just left.

- I spent an hour walking around the property talking to my fellow residents, just enjoying some conversation. Who knows if we talked about EliseAI. Who knows.

This must end, Your insatiable capture of Our Homes the whole nation over with a multinational PropTech cartel. You drive up our prices without remorse so that You can spend Your Capital on Hoaxes to run against us, and then feign Your Helplessness while You Enrich Yourselves and the AI vendors who intend for Your Financial Destruction too.

**You Sold Us With Enthusiasm.**

> "they wanna take different responsibilities off their plate"

**For what? So that you don't have to do Your Job?**

**You won't have a job, once these Agents are through with you.** Even Minna Song thinks so. She doesn't even come from this industry. She thinks My Home is a Product for her and you to wield against me on a compounding basis, and intends to release predictive algorithms that let you gouge me appropriately when it detects that you have broken me into leaving.

**And You Love Vacancies. Time to turn the price up even higher.**

**Minna Song intends to centralize all of America's multifamily housing operations offshore**, And Then Bleed Us Forever having gotten You to pay them for the opportunity, with Our Money You Seized With Rent Software.

**I will make You illegal.**

I have scheduled both a live demo with EliseAI, and a return meeting with the property management.

#### Questions

Given that this LLM is fundamentally unknown to all residents and does not expressly identify its nature when it instigates contact autonomously, my questions are these:

1. On what date was my personally identifiable information (PII) first given to the LLM?
2. At what frequency does the LLM receive updates to our PII?
  - If the LLM is the source of truth and does not need async updates, that's important to know.
3. Why did the LLM initiate contact with me? What _exactly_ instigated this contact?
4. What decision-making powers are enumerated for the LLM?
5. Can the LLM make decisions without your foreknowledge?
6. What does your database schema allow you to track about me?
7. Have you read the EliseAI Privacy Policy?
8. Who makes digital service purchases for the property?
9. If EliseAI suffers a data breach, what is your responsibility to protect my privacy, if any?
10. Can EliseAI resell derivative metadata about me to its own partners?
11. Where are you most likely to work after they fire you for being less efficient than an LLM?
12. Can EliseAI retain all of my PII after I am no longer financially obligated to you?

### Followup

- At the return visit, the human agent of Brookfield Properties listened to the questions recorded above. I skipped only the one about where they'll work after they lose their jobs.
- The human agent failed to record any of these, and latently tried to summarize my questions as a request for which triggers allow the LLM hoax to decide to contact me. This damaged summary was performed because they felt the other questions were being addressed then, in situ. This was not the case: The human agent's answers were all I-Don't-Knows or improvised conjecture.

#### Request Cannot Be Completed

- On October 30 2025, the legal team representing Brookfield Properties with an address in Ontario Canada sent me a receipt of my request, some 14 days after their human agent received it.
- The link they provided to "verify" my identity for proof of which state I live in (How could I live anywhere but the property they sell me?) was a broken link that led to an HTTP 404.
- The wording of their receipt acknowledgement made it highly ambiguous whether they considered October 16 or 30 as the receipt date.
- I issued a second signed document requesting they attest to the date, and whether their human agent was in fact an agent representing them.
- They did not acknowledge my second letter directly, but improperly quoted from it the sabotaged date of October 17, instead of 16.
- They are freestyling without verifying their own obligations.
- They issued a new link.
- The new link was a quiz with no notice of time limits, but on a particularly egregious question about which other states some random person from my extended family owns property (??), I paused the quiz to receive a phone call.
- I returned to the quiz to find that I was locked out, having "failed" my verification. The platform emailed me confirmation that my data privacy request would not be honored.

- At no point is a human's name visible in this process. All emails exchanged on the platform are from concealed identities, while they try to harass mine.
- I wrote back to condescend and I demanded that they reset the process, and not to test me lest I swing at them harder.

### Silence

Having begun the new quiz, I was faced with a question about address verification and a sibling's birth month. Since I don't talk to all of my siblings or use social media (nor do my siblings), I took the time to very `very` carefully avoid tabbing out of the web session and triggering its invisible time limit.

I shook the mouse while I ran a group text with my siblings to help me validate the month. I clicked the page and scrolled around while I waited for a reply from a sibling who doesn't answer their phone very often.

The address verification question put to me a list of addresses. I have lived in more than one city that uses a grid system for its road names, and so the numbers and East/West directional names are a blur. I barely memorized the address when I lived there, and barely recall it now.

Having filled out this quiz to the best of my ability and recollection, I submitted it, and was instantly told again that I did not pass verification.

What followed was a period of silence that would last until December 1. This, despite my numerous attempts to follow up with any signal at all that I was still watching them.

#### Reviews

> Hi Francesca,

> In one week, on the afternoon of November 16th, I will be in a room with the Colorado governor candidates in Denver by their invitation, and I will be discussing your company with them by name. They already affirmatively possess my query for them in text form, making the Nov 16th discussion just a rebroadcasting of it to a room full of devoted listeners.

> Are there any updates on some of the specific questions I had which you wrote down?

> Specifically I'd like to possess the true and complete list of reasons the unsupervised LLM product can make unsolicited contact without a human's explicit authorization or prior knowledge. The hypothetical reasons we discussed in person were not sufficient, as I said then. (This isn't a CPA-bound request, just the question I gave you separately 3 weeks ago and 2 weeks ago.)

I never received a reply to this email to her. I have received other replies to other emails. They were quite busy in November running back-to-back community events, in the run up to asking for our feedback via survey and publicly on Google reviews.

On November 19, the property sent out an email request to us to fill out their private survey, and then to leave a public review on Google, so I obliged.

Elise AI is working on new products that needle you into moving out, so that they can further optimize how to raise rent when you create a vacancy.

In the above email quotation, I am referring to the Community Conversation event run by Colorado Sun, at the Center for Creativity in Fort Collins. I am a board member at Fort Collins Public Media, who operates in that same building, so I know the space well.

#### Community Conversations

At the Colorado Sun event which I attended with Chris Crewnshaw of [://fcreport.org](//fcreport.org), I was privileged to sit at a round table that included Tammy L. Terwelp and Dana Coffield, of KUNC and Colorado Sun respectively. I was the table's note-taker and conversation stimulator.

As we posed each other questions about the state of journalism, Tammy disclosed that she was involved in news as a CEO (but does not assert any editorial influence). Dana chimed in that she should disclose that she was a co-founder and senior editor at Colorado Sun, the local organization putting on the event.

Chris Crewnshaw disclosed shortly after that he had started a 501(c)(3) non-profit newsroom in the area.

Tammy joked whether anyone else had a disclosure to make, as now half the table had made one.

I nodded along and followed up the levity with my own disclosure: I made and contribute to ANTIBODY.

I have photos of their business cards, which they gave to me. I wrote my contact information on a sticky note and they took pictures of it, having listened to my perspectives and having found wisdom in several. I made Tammy and Dana nod along to a point I made about `serendipity`.

Companies across this country, and no doubt across the world, abuse their position of anonymity. These community conversations are vital. My question to the Colorado Sun staff who lined up in a loose standing line for a Q&A was simple and direct:

**If social media were to vanish tomorrow, or if all of you were to lose access to your accounts, how would you spread your work to the community it impacts?**

I looked around at them all as I asked this, to make it clear I was a human talking to humans, not a muppet asking a rehearsed question. After they gave answers (which I found insufficient, but I took joy in the idea that I had sent them away thinking harder in the aftermath) I drew a common response from others in the audience:

> That was a really good question.

### Too Late

**On the 44th day** since my delivery of my invocation of the Colorado Privacy Act, in a signed letter to Francesca Volante, a verified agent of Brookfield Properties, I received a spontaneous followup from the anonymous identity known only to me as Service Account. I had sent them nothing since the quotation above on November 19.

I have yet to read one word of anything said `Sincerely` from Service Account.

Methinks they're about to ask for an extension.
