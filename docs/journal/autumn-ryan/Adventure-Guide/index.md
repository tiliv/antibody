This piece is about local companies who are marketing inside pamphlets that nobody is looking at. I am helping these businesses spread their business names and links, without compensation or ad spends. I hope to help these businesses notice that the meaning of an ad campaign has nothing to do with social media.

I am using the words they use in these pamphlets, and I am supressing all references to their social media accounts.
