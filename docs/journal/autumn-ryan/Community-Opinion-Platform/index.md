**With the retreat of local community outlets,** home- and away-grown to service NoCo by a sort of legacy charity, we find it difficult to keep our City Councils informed of our opinions. The speaking times are pressurized by issues that far exceed the bandwidth available now. We don't wish to flood that specific channel and even experience not talking at all despite signing up (too late). Even so, the speaking slots are distinctly not conversations, and must be rehearsed what for the volume of content that does in fact need to be transmitted.

**I come from Kentucky. In 2000, they saw they were hemorrhaging talent to other states.** Do not allow your public services to go derelict and gone. You will need to recover these eventually, and every moment makes it harder to undo. This is birth-rate science for ideas. You must understand that it is now unavoidable that Northern Colorado will bleed its journalism and commentary skills to other more useful venues.

**To preserve the City Councils and their specific format for commentary** we promote the formation of public-run opinion services for Fort Collins, with local identity and local hands. No small impetus is the loss of Letters to the Editor, which were vestigial when run for us by outlets elsewhere.

**The decline and removal of these offerings is explainable** though we find ourselves in need of pieces and symbols to reference and share on web links. This world requires more than can fit in City Council timed comments. It is not sufficient to attempt telepathy for three minutes (two and fifty-nine and fifty-nine seconds; two and fifty-nine and...) before their Very Long meeting has to take place.

**City Councils must not reach the point of being pressured in their public yard.** It is true it is our only outlet, but the problem is a cascade of others. There must be public media projects that uphold core systems of discourse if we are to secure for ourselves references and symbols of our shared beliefs. The Cities must be able to aggregate us for those shared concerns, and we can hold back from rushing for our time before Councils by individually reporting our overlapping but varied concerns.

**Currently envisioned as the Fort Collins Community Opinion Platform,** a group of locals are meeting in town for software and hosting, both in general mentorship and for streamlined materials assistance. To run a service without complex training, the common tools of web publishing are valuable, as are the recommendations made by their representatives in our area, some with prior experience in supporting community projects. In collaborating, we hope to locate new and energized support for something that is available but still disassembled.

**It is up to public organizations and their department heads to find willpower** for these projects. We are devoted to this idea and its staffing with locals young and old. Stories are not rare of marginalized groups seeing Themselves in media and becoming more inspired. We need not require it, but its active promotion inspires. We need to see each other in endeavors of public good to understand that skilled and aspiring locals can stay and participate.

**An opinion outpost which invites discussion without undue tension** can prove an example in a stark landscape of options for locals to use, to practice their powers of communication with each other. They can scarcely imagine it, so gone is local media.

**The Search Era made local searches for information redundant** but with our actual local supports now missing, we are plunged into a relative fog in our own cities (save for what national services and apps show us, with implicit profiteering motives in sponsored results for national brands).

**Our access to our local People is dangerously filtered by apps and services.** Companies control the way discourse is made visible. This is their feed curation in action. We must not allow those many national organizations to divide us by algorithm, fated for mass viewership goals.

**Opinion platforms with established reputation will grow in time** and become diverse in their methods of inviting locals to know and care about anything. Future journalists may find a taste for what they find, and tenured residents have a place to show their wisdom and let us learn from our age barriers.

**Our Social Fabric is damaged, but we are mending it for renewed use.**
