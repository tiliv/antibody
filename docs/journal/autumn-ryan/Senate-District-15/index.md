### Janice Marchman

- Education
- Joint technology committee
- Loveland affordible housing taskforce

Senator for three sessions. Historically this was a R+12 district. In 2021, after the 2020 census, this became at a 50/50 district.

She was outraised and outspent, but they worked hard. first democrat elected to SD-15 in many years.

4th stop on a 6-stop journey during election season.

Recurring issues, including affordibility.

Water rates becoming more affordable.

#### Xcel Energy

They shut down power during a windstorm. City of Loveland wasn't directly affected because of buried lines, but Xcel is planning to increase rates by 10%.

Data center(s) in Windsor/Greeley raising demand.

> Conservation Colorado has been really leading the effor to make sure data centers that come here are done in a way that is net neutral for water.

Imported water.

> The power shutoff was part of the Marshal fire.

> The disaster was part of what I got to help constituents work through.

> Xcel created this incredible process to figure out how we were going to turn off the power.

> But every time this happens, there are little moles that pop up.

- whack-a-mole description

> In Nederland, they had a 4-day power shutoff

Fires.

> Business owners lost everything. Insurance companies won't pay a claim on a "planned outage".

> They can't get anything but Xcel. They can't get anything back when they lose money. They're kinda stuck with that.

> Boulder County has some rules that require someof their pumps to be grinder pumps as part of water and sewer. They are completely electric. When the power goes out there are only 10 gallons of water and it becomes a sanitary issue.

> We've been moving towards closing down coal, meeting environmental targets.

> A lot of the expenses are expenses to upgrade infrastructure for that upgrade.

> Putting together caps on utility rate increases.

- Munis
- Investor
- Co-opts

20k jobs were supposed to expand solar and wind, and Lauren Boebert ruined that. They have a plan to do Green Bonds to do more without taxes.

- This continues to be interesting as a discussion because TABOR is not gone yet, even though we're often overriding limits on a city-by-city basis.

Solar panels for individuals helps take the edge off.

China is out-manufacturing us on solar panels.

- They're policy implements it a lot more, too, by an order of magnitude.

#### Medicare For All

- Would you vote for that bill?

Janice wrote that bill, studies will be done later this year.

Loveland lost a hospital location.

#### Child care funding and food support

Federal

Data retention in data centers. Education can't handle that.

Today, they can't even look at the bill becuse they have to deal with the impending crisis with funding.

On Monday is a senate retreat to put heads together and figure out what to do, setting aside bills to put more focus on insulating us.

Freight rail safety controls being antagonized because we want to do rail between Denver and Fort Collins.

Have a steady plan to make a steady plan. We are scrambling. Watching Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Political violence in the state previously.

> We are in a four alarm crisis.

> It's front and center.

One budget thing we've been doing is identifying our departments that are sourced by federal funds. See what's getting hit the most.

WIC.

> We don't have the funds to backfill.

Early childcare bill that just passed might be our only saving grace.

- It might not be much more than signaling, without the money.

#### Trans youth

U.S. Government suing children's hospital. Have to stop providing care to trans youth, medication, etc.

- Opponents are frequently talking about surgery but they are always targeting basic medications that rely on a sex discrimination argument. This means that medication is labeled as illegal based on the sex of the person taking it, which is textbook sex discrimination, but doesn't seem to faze anybody.

The parents and students are impacted by these issues. Local wants it to be more of a state issue. Cannot compel a private company to do anything.

Denver Health is private even though we subsidize it. It can't be told what to do.

#### Sex offenders

Home opened in the neighborhood and someone began renting it to five child sex offenders, plans to increase it to eight. Convictions, substance abuse. 4-block proximity to school. CARR-permitted a facility.

*[CARR]: Colrado Agency for Recovery Residences

Bipartisan, local was Bernie deligate, a Trump flag-flyer is on the same page. Goal would be to limit how many sex offenders live in the same location. Proposed limit 2. Trouble selling houses in the neighborhood.

School has put up fencing, unique compared to other schools.

Concern that there is a propensity to place these within school range.

- Unlikely to be directly, but the rural area might not have clear rules.

> Sounds like it's [becoming] a public safety issue.

> I'd love to put your in touch with DPS.

*[DPS]: Department of Public Safety

Here, there is no on-site staff. Concern with how few barriers there are.

- Trisha is frequently going off on national social media-tier issues. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Epstein. This is missing the local issue. Sharp blame on Republicans for not getting a return on TABOR. Very broad anti-focus, talking like a soundbite generator. Bad Venezuela, offshore accounts.

> Trisha: I'm going to the mat on that. We have to get rid of Lauren Boebert, though.

> Trisha: MAGA is not a coherent coalition. [...] I was just on conservative radio today. [...] I've worked with MAGA republicans. I was Bernie Sanders very first press intern, by the way.

#### Proud of Colorado

Tina Peters. Governor is wavering on this. Thinks sentence was too long.

- Polis needs to straighten up. During this meeting, I wrote and sent an email to our governor urging him not to bend on this. Within two days, he gave an interview to

#### Tipping Point

> We have to transition to renewables, yesterday.

Partners at all levels.

Trisha comes from US National Science Foundation. Technology going to farmers, storing carbon, and more.

> People are waking up.

Hottest winter on record. We have to respond.

Local idea:

1. Incentives to reimburse for renewables
2. Incentivize districts to get them to do things that conserve water

- There is a vibe here about removing costly grass and doing more that is water-wise.

#### Disabilities

Easier licensing for businesses to hire kid with disabilities

- I think I understood the question but she was weaving a lot of interrupting thoughts

Decommissioning coal plants.

political will, governor veto

$300M back

provided without licensing, need in-training designator. losing therapists

#### State Budget after DC cuts

Asking about big picture shortfalls.

#### ConnectingColorado

County is losing power.
