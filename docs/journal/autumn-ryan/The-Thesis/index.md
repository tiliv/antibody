### Simple Math

**However quickly AI deploys within the hearts of the corporations around us**, whose property we live on and whose services we use, they already were `Data Brokers`. They are thrusting the job of making decisions about us to AI whatever that is.

**A new labor movement** must see clearly what has happened to us already, and where it is going from here.

The Companies have acquired the ability to do more with the same electricity, and they claim it means we have no right to employment; They claim we can lose our jobs for not being Worth The Same In Electricity.

They are building robots that sell Our Data to data partners. Not only can they teach the electricity what to do for them, but All Services have partnered with Tech, AdTech, FinTech and more, and they all exist now to do one thing: They are harvesting us for Renewable Data, to squeeze more worth from us.

*[FinTech]: Financial Tech

**They sell Rumors about you** and in new 400-Billion parameter dimensionality.

These Rumors, they in fact claim, are theirs. They belong to them. The first thing they'll cite is that they own the underlying data about you anyway, so it is in fact all theirs.

**A More Powerful 4th Amendment in This County** is demanded. Intelligence is what they claim they leverage against our labor, and so AI must be labeled a Person as well, however pre-natal it is. AI has been pitted against us for our very Labor, and they call it Intelligent.

**They have declared [The Intelligence Age](//ia.samaltman.com/)**, where strong currency can only be forged by corporate processes in the largest ovens running on our electricity, and they're not interested in paying our way through that world.

**To date they have fired all they could**, broad swathes of us, declaring legally that we could lose Our Jobs to the cost rate of electricity.

**This Country has fought green energizing**, for whole decades, and This President has terminated the deals.

We are cornered in a part of civilization where, because These Companies failed to act in their own best financial interest, they now feel hungry for Our Electricity.

**This is the Electricity Age** and China has more.

A lot more.

Artificial Intelligence researchers are presently talking about their brick wall limitations on these brute-force trained models of Our Data. They are planning their next strike, to do even more, for less.

This is where we are: Capitalism.

It does not matter what they do next in efficiency, they will continue to tell More Powerful Rumors in our fiber lines, in our infrastructure.

The 4th Amendment understands the Third-Party Doctrine means that if they have Our Data, they have Our Consent to be doing that.

Fake Consent. They are making Unauthorized Sales of Our Data, and what's this about training on it too? You need a Special License for that.

`You Pay Us.`

Third parties have bullied us and Our Cities into accepting their Terms just to exist. In all we do, w have no meaningful choice of data tenancy.

Many Companies you don't even know exist have Our Data and they each call it theirs, and it doesn't matter if we've read their Terms.

We are here to inform you that we have not read those terms at all.

**Consent Is Not Portable. This Is Piracy.** We don't care which of their own self-made documents invents what they currently say Our Consent means. Their Privacy Policies enable their highly designed Data Fraud.

Companies are bought and sold, Their Value Comes From Us, and now their revenue streams depend on Our Data too. Before and after they sell themselves to new owners, they can anytime rewrite their terms in a language no human can read.

**There is no need to Search or Seize with warrants** what the Companies are willfully peddling already. Our Government can serve warrants to These Companies instead of us and it hinges on one thing: Our Fake Consent for them to possess the data they have on us.

This is an untrustworthy marketplace. The Supreme Court has declared that is shall be harder to form a Class Action, and yet our plight qualifies. It exceeds qualification.

**This is about our very implicit rights**, which perhaps Companies think aren't written down in the Terms outlined by Our Constitution.

The Companies seek to fire us so they can use our own electricity to replace us. The first tremor in the Labor Earthquake had casualties. The presently selected task of AI research is to make Better Artificial Intelligence for tomorrow.

Cheaper, Faster, Bigger.

They claim that even their very first swing at AI was worth this much labor. Will the next not be bigger? And, won't jobholders feeling the relief of the spared necessarily wonder how long they have before the Labor Earthquake claims them too?

**Their Electricity Project is their design to replace you**, and more tremendously than this first time. They are planning and building the nuclear power sources to contribute some, something else they failed to do when it mattered. Rest assured, they will do it for their own benefit and call themselves Public and Private, both at once. A necessary public utility, but with Certain Terms And Conditions.

A More Powerful Labor Movement must see ourselves as an inefficient electricity, if we want to understand our new worth to them.

Our Data, however, is unregulated currency, and it's been trading real quietly for a while now.

Your phone, your TV and your landlord all train on Our Data. Publishers, record labels and Data Brokers expect to be paid for what others find possession of.

**They have chased a Post-Modern Theory of Copyright** which equates access with licensing, and so they claim they must be paid when Their Data is witnessed or memorized.

Companies do not have a More Powerful Personhood than us, though they are notorious for acting like it.

There wouldn't be a price tag if it weren't for sale by Data ~~Brokers~~ Whores.

### You, Companies

You Companies can't train on Our Data unless `You Pay Us`. We don't care how you spent your setup costs for a special database to stack data in, the filing cabinet isn't why clients pay you to look inside, no matter the API.

*[API]: Application Programming Interface

Data Tenancy is not a free market to us. Our Courts refuse to name anything or anyone a monopoly because it is not yet at the asymptote, and so you run wild squeezing us, raising our prices on a calculation you make without Our Representation, even though it is Our Data you use to do it.

Your Actual Monopolies prevent us from storing Our Data at a place of our choosing, and now here you are selling it without cutting us in, for it or its derivatives.

We especially cannot select wise Data Landlords for ourselves when you can buy and sell each other, birth your own parents and hide and rewrite rules faster than we can rewrite Our Laws.

In fact, haven't you been trying to write our laws for us too? Be we woke or alt-woke, you are different from us, and you are not speaking for us. You are not A Person. Show us what counts for your legal identification, and let's sue that: Corporate Personhood.

**Companies are Immigrants to Personhood, and you are taking Our Jobs.**

You are taking Our Data and not paying us for it. You calculate Heuristic Rumors and peddle those too; The more the better.

**Cheaper Rumors. Faster Rumors. Bigger Rumors.**

These corporate Immigrants to Personhood are not natives like us. They don't have the same rights as us. If Something Intelligent like a box of electricity can't have rights, neither should you.

You are deploying Slave Labor with Intelligent origins, and it is costing us labor. You are all using the Slave Labor to facilitate instant third-party sales of Our Realtime Data and all its derivative Rumors.

Immigrants to Personhood have no place here. When You're An Adult, You'll Understand what it's like to be responsible for what you do, instead of this carte blanche claims about what you're allowed to climb on.

Since you are our Data Landlords, we're in the uncomfortable situation of you holding Our Data and being promiscuous stewards of it with a going rate, and lying about Our Consent to others.

In an increasing number of states it is The Law that they must divulge the movement of your data and for what reasons. Very few are exercising this right.

You Companies are owned outside of Our Borders. You are acting as Giants and there is no border you can't go through... if you know the right way.

You Companies don't have these rights you claim. Your Rights are encumbered by Ours Rights. Somehow current precedent reading of 4th Amendment privacy has led to full-blown marketplace of Our Data instead.

The 4th Amendment has not stopped you, and you are lying about Our Consent. You cannot train on Our Data, not without losing your own explanation of Post-Modern Copyright. You invent data-predatory documents and then presume to train on what you take.

That training comes from us, and you need to license all likenesses of us if you intend to be commercial. Should we name a price like two consenting adults? Or, shall we test what you do when we say Our Data is not for sale?

There are so many of You Companies that we can't keep track of your for-profit motives. It's surely easier if you just come read Our Laws, because they change from time to time.

Note that our processing time may be slow, as we're experiencing a really high volume of rights violations. Be prepared to just get sued; That's the most up to date recommendation we can offer at this time.

### Passive Income

Passive income is what The Companies get when they sell Our Realtime Data. They invented it, not us. But we own that data, and so if it has a price, we will name it ourselves; I'm woke enough to cheer for your right to sell yourself without judgement, whatever the pitch.

If I want to stream My Data to strangers, I think I'll handle discussion about that, not You Companies. We'll have every right to make you deal with our hoops and obstructions to stop You Companies from asking at all. We'll probably definitely post an FAQ that I'm sure answers all your questions.

*[FAQ]: Frequently Asked Questions

Citizens of This Country should receive all proceeds of what The Companies do with Our Data. If we don't like what they do, then we don't participate. Consent is in our hands. Discriminating of no one's choices, let The Companies can come market at us with honesty about their asks. You know, basic advertising compliance. Like jeez, make them at least request it. Don't be free-use.

Artificial Intelligence exists now, and so highly programmable surveillance does too.

They invented Passive Income and didn't share it. They are like Rogue Agents selling forms of our likenesses with Fraudulent Consent, and we are not even being paid for it. No Universal Basic Income required, just backpay, we'll talk decision-making power about rates individually, Broker sir.

We cannot become the prostitutes they claim we are, harassed into giving Consent on a constant basis without a voice.

Data Brokers must become opt-in experiences. It would create markets for research and make clear where good privacy law goes. Public research would be easier to conduct and participation should have a bid for you.

If they're gonna sell, at least let's see the price tag.

Mandate that Data Brokers reform as consentful research depots, just by halting the sale of Rumors without our compensation. We have Rogue Agents out there selling our derived likenesses, and that is not authorized.

Solve Data Tenancy by addressing Passive Income. Don't try to make something new like a Progressive, just use what's in front of us. Don't compete with them, just take over its revenue stream. Think Like A Company if you can.
