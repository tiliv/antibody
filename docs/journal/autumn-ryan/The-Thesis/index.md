### Simple Math

**However quickly AI deploys within the hearts of the corporations around us**, whose property we live on and whose services we use, they already were `Data Brokers`. They are thrusting the job of making decisions about us to AI whatever that is.

**A new labor movement** must see clearly what has happened to us already, and where it is going from here.

The Companies have acquired the ability to do more with the same electricity, and they claim it means we have no right to employment; They claim we can lose our jobs for not being Worth The Same In Electricity.

They are building robots that sell Our Data to data partners. Not only can they teach the electricity what to do for them, but All Services have partnered with Tech, AdTech, FinTech and more, and they all exist now to do one thing: They are harvesting us for Renewable Data, to squeeze more worth from us.

*[AdTech]: Advertisement Tech
*[FinTech]: Financial Tech

**They sell Rumors about you** and in new 400-Billion parameter dimensionality.

These Rumors, they in fact claim, are theirs. They belong to them. The first thing they'll cite is that they own the underlying data about you anyway, so it is in fact all theirs.

**A More Powerful 4th Amendment in This County** is demanded. Intelligence is what they claim they leverage against our labor, and so AI must be labeled a Person as well, however pre-natal it is. AI has been pitted against us for our very Labor, and they call it Intelligent.

**They have declared [The Intelligence Age](//ia.samaltman.com/)**, where strong currency can only be forged by corporate processes in the largest ovens running on our electricity, and they're not interested in paying our way through that world.

- [://ia.samaltman.com/](//ia.samaltman.com/)

**To date they have fired all they could**, broad swathes of us, declaring legally that we could lose Our Jobs to the cost rate of electricity.

**This Country has fought green energizing**, for whole decades, and This President has terminated the deals.

We are cornered in a part of civilization where, because These Companies failed to act in their own best financial interest, they now feel hungry for Our Electricity.

**This is the Electricity Age** and China has more.

A lot more.

Artificial Intelligence researchers are presently talking about their brick wall limitations on these brute-force trained models of Our Data. They are planning their next strike, to do even more, for less.

This is where we are: Capitalism.

It does not matter what they do next in efficiency, they will continue to tell More Powerful Rumors in our fiber lines, in our infrastructure.

The 4th Amendment understands the Third-Party Doctrine means that if they have Our Data, they have Our Consent to be doing that.

Fake Consent. They are making Unauthorized Sales of Our Data, and what's this about training on it too? You need a Special License for that.

`You Pay Us.`

Third parties have bullied us and Our Cities into accepting their Terms just to exist. In all we do, w have no meaningful choice of data tenancy.

Many Companies you don't even know exist have Our Data and they each call it theirs, and it doesn't matter if we've read their Terms.

We are here to inform you that we have not read those terms at all.

**Consent Is Not Portable. This Is Piracy.** We don't care which of their own self-made documents invents what they currently say Our Consent means. Their Privacy Policies enable their highly designed Data Fraud.

Companies are bought and sold, Their Value Comes From Us, and now their revenue streams depend on Our Data too. Before and after they sell themselves to new owners, they can anytime rewrite their terms in a language no human can read.

**There is no need to Search or Seize with warrants** what the Companies are willfully peddling already. Our Government can serve warrants to These Companies instead of us and it hinges on one thing: Our Fake Consent for them to possess the data they have on us.

This is an untrustworthy marketplace. The Supreme Court has declared that is shall be harder to form a Class Action, and yet our plight qualifies. It exceeds qualification.

**This is about our very implicit rights**, which perhaps Companies think aren't written down in the Terms outlined by Our Constitution.

The Companies seek to fire us so they can use our own electricity to replace us. The first tremor in the Labor Earthquake had casualties. The presently selected task of AI research is to make Better Artificial Intelligence for tomorrow.

Cheaper, Faster, Bigger.

They claim that even their very first swing at AI was worth this much labor. Will the next not be bigger? And, won't jobholders feeling the relief of the spared necessarily wonder how long they have before the Labor Earthquake claims them too?

**Their Electricity Project is their design to replace you**, and more tremendously than this first time. They are planning and building the nuclear power sources to contribute some, something else they failed to do when it mattered. Rest assured, they will do it for their own benefit and call themselves Public and Private, both at once. A necessary public utility, but with Certain Terms And Conditions.

A More Powerful Labor Movement must see ourselves as an inefficient electricity, if we want to understand our new worth to them.

Our Data, however, is unregulated currency, and it's been trading real quietly for a while now.

Your phone, your TV and your landlord all train on Our Data. Publishers, record labels and Data Brokers expect to be paid for what others find possession of.

**They have chased a Post-Modern Theory of Copyright** which equates access with licensing, and so they claim they must be paid when Their Data is witnessed or memorized.

Companies do not have a More Powerful Personhood than us, though they are notorious for acting like it.

There wouldn't be a price tag if it weren't for sale by Data ~~Brokers~~ Whores.

### You, Companies

You Companies can't train on Our Data unless `You Pay Us`. We don't care how you spent your setup costs for a special database to stack data in, the filing cabinet isn't why clients pay you to look inside, no matter the API.

*[API]: Application Programming Interface

Data Tenancy is not a free market to us. Our Courts refuse to name anything or anyone a monopoly because it is not yet at the asymptote, and so you run wild squeezing us, raising our prices on a calculation you make without Our Representation, even though it is Our Data you use to do it.

Your Actual Monopolies prevent us from storing Our Data at a place of our choosing, and now here you are selling it without cutting us in, for it or its derivatives.

We especially cannot select wise Data Landlords for ourselves when you can buy and sell each other, birth your own parents and hide and rewrite rules faster than we can rewrite Our Laws.

In fact, haven't you been trying to write our laws for us too? Be we woke or alt-woke, you are different from us, and you are not speaking for us. You are not A Person. Show us what counts for your legal identification, and let's sue that: Corporate Personhood.

**Companies are Immigrants to Personhood, and you are taking Our Jobs.**

You are taking Our Data and not paying us for it. You calculate Heuristic Rumors and peddle those too; The more the better.

**Cheaper Rumors. Faster Rumors. Bigger Rumors.**

These corporate Immigrants to Personhood are not natives like us. They don't have the same rights as us. If Something Intelligent like a box of electricity can't have rights, neither should you.

You are deploying Slave Labor with Intelligent origins, and it is costing us labor. You are all using the Slave Labor to facilitate instant third-party sales of Our Realtime Data and all its derivative Rumors.

Immigrants to Personhood have no place here. When You're An Adult, You'll Understand what it's like to be responsible for what you do! Instead, you have enjoyed carte blanche claims about what you can do without consequence.

Since you are our Data Landlords, we're in the uncomfortable situation of you holding Our Data and being promiscuous stewards of it with a going rate, and lying about Our Consent to others.

In an increasing number of states it is The Law that they must divulge the movement of your data and for what reasons. Very few are exercising this right.

You Companies are owned outside of Our Borders. You are acting as Giants and there is no border you can't go through... if you know the right way.

You Companies don't have these rights you claim. Your Rights are encumbered by Ours Rights. Somehow the current precedent reading of 4th Amendment privacy has led to full-blown marketplace of Our Data instead.

The 4th Amendment has not stopped you, and you are lying about Our Consent. You cannot train for free on Our Data, not without losing your own explanation of Post-Modern Copyright. You invent data-predatory documents and then presume to be justified in training on what you took in the shadows.

You need to license all likenesses of us if you intend to be commercial. Should we name a price like two consenting adults? Or, shall we watch you react when we say Our Data is not for sale At All?

There are so many of You Companies that we can't keep track of your for-profit motives. We don't have direct relationships with you while you lay claim to our identities.

Instead of making us find all of you, it's surely easier if you just come to us, to read Our Laws. They change from time to time.

Note that our processing times may be slow, as we're experiencing a really high volume of rights violations. Be prepared to just get sued; That's the most up to date recommendation we can offer at this time.

### Passive Income

Passive income is what The Companies get when they sell Our Realtime Data. We own that data, and so if it has a price, we will name it ourselves; I'm woke enough to cheer for your right to sell yourself without judgement, whatever the pitch.

If I want to stream My Data to strangers, I think I'll handle discussion about that, not The Companies. We'll have every right to make you deal with our hoops and obstructions to stop You Companies from asking at all. We'll probably definitely post an FAQ that I'm sure answers all their questions.

*[FAQ]: Frequently Asked Questions

Citizens of This Country should receive all proceeds of what The Companies do with Our Data. If we don't like what they do, then we don't participate. Consent is in our hands. Discriminating of no one's choices, let The Companies can come market at us with honesty about their asks. You know, like basic advertising compliance. Like jeez, make them at least request it. Don't be free-use.

Artificial Intelligence exists now, and so highly programmable surveillance does too.

They invented Passive Income and didn't share it. They are like Rogue Agents selling forms of our likenesses with Fraudulent Consent, and we are not even being paid for it. No Universal Basic Income required, just backpay, we'll talk decision-making power about rates individually, Broker sir.

We cannot become the prostitutes they claim we are, harassed into giving Consent on a constant basis without a voice.

Data Brokers must become opt-in experiences. It would create markets for research and make clear where good privacy law goes. Public research would be easier to conduct and participation should have a bid for you.

If they're gonna sell, at least let's see the price tag.

Mandate that Data Brokers reform as consentful research depots, just by halting the sale of Rumors without our compensation. We have Rogue Agents out there selling our derived likenesses, and that is not authorized.

Solve Data Tenancy by addressing Passive Income. Don't try to make something new like a Progressive, just use what's in front of us. Don't compete with them, just take over its revenue stream. Think Like A Company if you can.

### Likeness and Licensing

Since we cannot prevent AI unfolding in our space, we shall have to make room for it. At present, The Companies steal from us, and make money doing it.

Layers of our public life have been given over to services like ParkMobile, who suffers data breaches of Our Data. Each company will claim they have No Responsibility for when Our Data gets loose, and then they sell it promiscuously in ways that no member of the public can follow. While they have Our Data Without Responsibility For It, of course it can end up anywhere.

**The Fines For Our Data Loss Are Compound.** We have seen the low quality take-all Privacy Policies that ParkMobile deploys, where 98% clean language can be invalidated by one quick turn to `Unless`. Exceptions carve out extensive power to Do More Without Asking Us.

They have been empowered this way because they can approve Fail Open Consent.

We are powerless to be heard by them, by Their Design, and They Keep Taking More while we cry `Stop`.

Our Governments must not delegate core functions to bro-tier Tech Toys where we pay them **and** give them Our Data. No official I have talked to has dived deeply into Privacy Policies or the core Terms and Conditions.

**We are not participating in The Terms And Conditions.** If Our Governments don't read them, then why should anyone assume that we are either?

We all know no one reads them. How, honestly, could anyone? It goes truly without saying that no one reads them.

Frequently, we seem bound by such documents even when we haven't heard of 'em before.

The Power Of Our Consent must be fundamental to New Labor.

At present, These Companies don't read Our Terms either. Our laws are trampled by the reality that they can make it hard, and turn high effort signs of No Consent away with no obligation to listen.

The Rape Of Our Consent Is Loud. It is everywhere. Companies operating in Colorado are "compliant" with the Colorado Privacy Act in the same way The Rapists haven't been caught yet. I receive non-compliant responses from companies, from Brookfield Properties to 2Auto Group (or its many shifting names). If they are reading the law, then they are even being Advised before giving bad responses.

The way out is to wrestle ourselves away from their feeding of technology, which now goes directly the hearts of our police departments and ownership of data that no one knows they gather. Presumably, Flock claims all their data comes from Our Consent because the police gave it on their behalf. One could participate in local government City Council meetings and never even know a contract started.

More layers are fallen to Not-Responsible Technology Firms, backed by Private Equity who can make anything free. Have they not demonstrated this by pouring money into technology firms Who Seem To Burn Money Worse The Bigger They Get?

OpenAI faces diverse criticisms, and a pressing one is this: Tech Firms are powered by Negative Money and They Don't Read.

And they call themselves People by Corporate Personhood, their Negative Money spending the same as Our Free Speech, and are apparently allowed to own Our Houses and Real Estate.

No matter what talking heads say about AI running out of data to train on, AI comes for us precisely because we give off the most continuous data, and we can't help it. We might choose to be flattered that they correctly assessed our importance.

Companies proved they were not interested in listening to us at any time, and now suddenly They All Have Their LLM Ears Pressed On Us because Now, Now They Really Are Listening.

If companies can listen this well and claim They Own It All, then change must occur: All AI agents representing and doing business in front of their brand must be capable of directing local privacy law requests to the right inbox.

If these Agents are sold to us on their ability to do anything, but don't have a finger on the privacy request pipeline either, Do You Think We Have A Problem?

Sufficiently Intelligent AI with words must be auditable for its ability to Do Literally Anything about what the AI received while Doing Business and be accountable.

If Our Data has a price, we shall set our own, you gremlins. And it'll be the price They Need To Pay Us for a license on our likeness, no matter how sparsely represented. If These Companies think they can make money because it is a likeness, they'll pay us up front, and for royalties in training and for part of the business graph they say they want to grow. If I give them My Stock, I better be the first one compensated for its demand.

Tech Firms are leading the pack for unaccountable behavior, but they are all capable. It is the Tech Firms who spend so much Negative Money against us and keep taking over Our Data and making us pay for it in our own Governments.

Tech Firms are expressly not responsible in every reading of their behaviors. They could be helping us be heard, and instead they're helping us be Not Heard. Social Media is a boiling pot watched by many, and what you see is shaped by Algorithms, whose court tests revealed it too was Un-Responsible for what it did.

Companies Admit Blame For Nothing, and you are not required to buy that plea. In certain worst cases, there is no competitor to flee to, and they have no greater obligations for it. They get to treat us like they have competitors, but they're using telescopes to spy the horizons to find any, and have no customer service, except through a landlord who is also selling my data.

Our Systems are not watching out for us. They are layered when try to throw them off, and they're all finding Our Data can be given away for corporate toy software to look at it with.

Capitalism's Private Equity will continue to inflate our assets while they still hold them. Our pain is actively fueling their financial gain, while they should have already been trod out on the streets on a court order to meet the buyers of previously stolen homes.

Companies which work with Our Governments, especially local, should be paying us a liability insurance fee, and additional fines when they inevitably lose control of data. The risk should be aligned to what These Companies perceive as risk. We can define the risks to them, and if they think twice about entering an industry, Good.

Companies which do not adhere to our local laws should be Ejected From Business Licensing In The State. Breaking our privacy in particular and building systems that don't let us talk to them, they should not be allowed.

Corporate Immigrants To Personhood which attempt to smuggle data over state lines, by a personal or private relationship or through affiliation, including by API, must operate under New Observability Principles.

Data which is composed of human subjects must have written approval per production, or a signed non-perpetual license for a durable approval.

The Surveillance Of Traits is rapidly becoming pure AI hearsay, and includes things that two people discussing it over lunch would have reason to blush if heard aloud.

No Agent should transact or perform any task that is not also transacted or performed by human employees, with the same data. Here, we secure monitors on what it is You Rumor about us, and simultaneously put it into the heads of humans who on the whole I have found reason to trust from time to time. and if those humans are willing to do the same work. We'd also like to have their reasons Why or Why Not in public filings about the AI pipeline.

AI Employee Managers will soon inhale meeting data and hold 1-on-1 meetings where you will be required to consent to someone warehousing data about a rough patch at work or metrics, and we won't have a choice. We are not only being replaced, the survivors are told to talk to the AI, going on the record for the interested parties to figure out what they wanted to ask about what they exfiltrate, Seized Without A Warrant or Meaningful Consent.

In the world we have, we should be paid for our digital likenesses fetching value with their partners, in aggregate or otherwise. Presently, they handle documents about us knowing that they own it all and that we already lack representation in the process.

Companies do not abide by Colorado Privacy Act rules. I can demonstrate this. Look Anywhere to start. They won't answer in compliant ways.

They are already not obeying the rules, and each disobedience perpetuates Fraud against Our Consent, Our Data used without licensing for commercial intent. We are owed profits and punitive awards on Every Company made to file public record intent to sell consumer data derivatives for any reason.

We must gain the ability to Sue Their Terms in our own medium, as it appears their digital Terms and Privacy documents change too continuously for preservation. If they had to file such notices and core documents in Each State, we make them preserve their intent in the records we find actionable, no longer this nebulous digital paper that wears a single edit date but changes often.

We may bring lawsuits over the document's failed obligations, reporting requirements or paid compensation to the city or to us individually.

There is no Federal Law that can govern, when we all have States of us. Chasing a national rule will harm our rights, as decided by States and Cities which we call home the most. It is good for them to differ, so that the companies can learn they must not sleep on the job of meeting their obligations. With national rules, they will be encouraged to become good friends with the inspector and find their passing marks on a government paper somewhere, like Our Consent ends up on their documents.

Fraudulent Consent must be a harm we can cite and demonstrate in public, and we need to be eager to eject These Companies from Our State and Our Government when they cannot cover sufficient data tenancy liability insurance for their publicly documented behavior.

Too often, when we are harmed by Companies, it is while our local authority cannot tell and is just one of you. These Companies can find themselves on a Peace Board. They have no need to care about borders or jurisdiction law. They are Too Giant.

Eagerly eject companies en route to Giantism from Your State. Look for and promote the use of local companies which have not been allowed to do business. Google has been setting the rate for being listed in certain kinds of results, and County Commissioners dropped business discovery resources.

Let us start hiring our proverbial neighbors, our own Actual People. Let us do it in mediums The Companies don't own or operate.

We need to know LICIL in every instance:

*[LICIL]: Landlord, Insurance, Custody, Intent, Licensing

1. who is our Data `Landlord`
2. where they get Data Loss `Insurance`
3. who by name has `Custody` of classes of data
4. how to express clear `Intent` Signals about Consent
5. the quantity awarded to us in `Licensing`

This is a distinct break from their simpler tradition of No Responsibility.

If we had power over, and no responsibility for, their internal data, they would be right to be nervous. They'd be nervous if they had a custodian as thoughtless with data as they are.

Governments should be firm in demanding quality expectations for civil infrastructure. As low as the parking meters, we are being harvested at the point of sale, and via location tracking on their app they sometimes force you to use. This includes where you go afterward when you check on the app.

At no point have I Meaningfully Consented to this specific system, because my Consent is being counted automatically, forged for new uses, and profited on.

Consent Forgery protections are now mandatory for us, and we are owed damages. Fines should put some of These Companies out of business. If one wants to gobble up the others and Do Consent Right, feel free. You could always do that.
