### City Hall

#### Ruination

For a year (and longer), Loveland has been sliding into a conservative fever dream that wishes to see its homeless population disappeared by hateful magic.

Without exaggeration, locals oppose all measures. They oppose new shelters. They oppose new locations for moved shelters. They oppose existing shelters. They oppose those who so much as speak to the homeless. They oppose those who survey businesses with a sympathetic lens.

They call themselves victims. They call themselves persecuted. They call their buisnesses victims.

They scream at us all.

Colorado is rapidly descending into severe unaffordability. The Unitary Executive has cut all childcare funding and food assistance in retribution for having convicted and imprisoned a Mesa County perpetrator of election fraud, Tina Peters, who exfiltrated access credentials to servants of fascism for the Election Fraud scheme of 2020.

AI is ensuring that all employment resources are mediated by private tech firms, whose primary business models exploit us while we sleep. They profile us, take possession of our data and peddle it like prostitutes.

Private Equity is becoming increasingly responsible for policing us while the cops are not even awake or present.

AI and Private Equity are compiling shadow profiles on us, and watch us fall, then help the police harass us.

For free, for discount and for promotion, there are tech startups which make money by driving you into a jail. Financial motives want to ruin you. The metrics of their success are ruination.

Loveland has moved to make certain that the homeless disappear, and they want our applause when they make people vanish.

### Loveland Public Library

#### Gertrude Scott Room

Relentless. Pursuit. Truth. Justice. For All.

Words are energy. However, your physical persence is more powerful than written or spoken words.

She is taking someone she doesn't know as a volunteer to demonstrate something. She picked someone who she doesn't know. She has him tell her where to move, how fast, with directions. She observes that he has to resort to using hand motions once relative directions are complicated once the gimbal lock is unfolding.

Next, she has him do it without words. They put a finger together and he pushed her about the space, while she walked backwards.

Physical presence alone (not knowing the person) guided her. There might be issues, but there is a mutual effort unfolding in realtime.

Corruption starts at the lowest level.

Transparency: She does not monetize stories about injustice on social media platforms. But she does sue corrupt agencies and dirty cops.

#### Who is The System?

Every agency that can be abbreviated is part of this network. City councils, elected county commissioners, police departments, boards, commissions, courts, district attorneys, public defenders, and more.

It does not include benevolent individuals who work in The System.

Corruption banks on the designs of the built in environment, icndlugint he intentional use of propaganda to silence you.

The more you stay silent, the more money they make.

The corruption controls the good guys.

It includes every private and or non-profit organization that takes money from the government. Government money is control of non-profits and private organizations. You may not be successful at your mission if this is you.

#### Asa Peck #B2401624

21-day jury trial in November 2025. Booking date Feb 28 2024.

White male, 150lbs, hair and eye color brown. Born 8/21/78. Height 5ft 11in.

Chantell Renee Wilkes in a relationship with him.

Both were unhoused in Loveland in 2022. Ms. Wilkes found deceased in the Big Thompson River near Barnes Park. Domestic violence and restraining orders.

The Loveland police department has a long history of evidence going missing. In this case, surveillance video at the Barnes Park bathroom went missing.

The homeless community culture didn't talk to the police, so the police released a bulletin to the inmates to bribe them for information about either person.

- It is constant, in our society, that The System deprives us of our needs, and then wave money around in our faces to compell us to do what is useful to them.

Two Jailhouse Snitches (official term in court) refused the money and helped anyway. The jury convicted on this information. Ms. Wilkes family and the jury were moved to tears by the good will demonstrated. Family was present for every step.

The witnesses were unhoused and incarcerated. The jury was selected with questions about bias about homelessness itself, such as if witnesses were overtly addicted or going through a withdrawal, etc. The trial was about homelessness itself. The witnesses arrived in an intimidating space and were allowed to give more credible testimony than the "expert witnesses". They came in orange jumpsuits and restraints. They swore to tell the truth before all, in shackles.

When a cop has to bribe an inmate for a conviction, there is a problem. It immediately calls into question motives on each side.

One of the witnesses was sentenced for corrections, but brought him back to Larimer County jail to testify. The night before he testified, he was assault. He came to court with a broken eye socket. He was attacked based on who he was testifying against. he testified because Ms. Wilkes was his friend.

### Tools

- Google Scholar (peer-reviewed, case law by state, articles from journals)
- Colorado Legal Self-Help System (serves people without attorneys)
- Read (library, audio)

Scrolling is different on your brain than turning a page.

The System has control because people are overwhelmed by surviving.

### Homelessness Feeds The System

Shelters feed The System, while housing does not.

Stepping outside of your comfort zone, read things you don't want to read.

The System knows that it is not working, but it keeps you in a chaos loop.

- Upstream: Dan Heath (The Quest to Solve Problems Before They Happen)
- Bench Ansfield: Born In Flames (Wealthy  builders and developers and slum lords intentionally design entire communities to be controlled by and dependent on The System)
- gardiner harris: no more tears (The System intentionally creates products that hurt people. And. The System intentionally prescribes drugs to get people addicted.)
- Timothy Egan: A Fever In The Heartland (The System designs programs to attack the most vulnerable people in our community and then design programs to "solve" the problem.)

### Ammunition

Don't give The System its Ammunition. They want to trap you, silence you, and "prove" you are who they designate. They want to incarcerate the truth seekers and silence the truth speakers.

Learn how narcissists and psychopaths are used by The System to terrorize innocent people. CIA declassified documents discuss this openly.

Always use an attorney for criminal cases. The System is designed top enalize you for not being part of the licensed club.

There are rock star public defenders in this county.

- Colorado in particular provides public defenders by a kind of state-wide system. It is uncommon in This Country.

Always make sure the attorney has your facts. The police record will say whatever they want it to say, regardless of anything.

Always check the record in your case, even if it's just a traffic ticket.

Correct the record, because it is sabotaged against you.

Take up space. The System wants you to be small, shamed and silent. They do not want you to be heard. When you are not unhinged, you are Provoked. Provcation implies upstream cause, not outburst.

Learn how to protect yourself from narcissists and psychopaths.

### Never Answer Questions

Ever.

K-9 Riggs, who misidentifies drugs on a constant basis. The dog needs to be retired because it is a joke in plain sight. Anything you say, the police can go back in time and rig the site to set up a frame story against you.

Loveland police knew there was a protection order.

### Take Up Space

Show The System that you are watching and that you are grateful when The System gets it right.

Attend Asa Peck's sentencing hearing.

> January 12 2026 at 1:30PM

> Courtroom 3A: Judge Joseph Findley

> 201 LaPorte Ave

> Fort Collins, Colorado 80521

Guilty of violating a protection order, sexual assault and murder.

### Loveland Is Dirty

Ongoing since 2007, Loveland police are corrupted. Good officers leave, or else get dirtied and ruined.

Tim Doran was appointed by City Manager Steve Adams, who was being sued for assault. Tim Doran has demonstrated apathy about snitching license plates to ICE. He doesn't understand anything. He is an apologist to fascism and The System of horrors.

I have been in the room with Tim Doran, and he has watched me leave the room while he talks.

He and Vince Junglas have email from me, having being included as intimidation for my promise to demonstrate how to learn how Flock cameras can be damaged.

Hi, Tim. Hi, Vince.
