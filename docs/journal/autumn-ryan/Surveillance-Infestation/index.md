### Search

In the city of Loveland, where we enjoy a smaller town atmosphere than nearby Fort Collins, I had a local police officer pull up on my position by the road. I have been dressing in much red (and some white and some blue), fancy tights and heels, and I stand there pointing at the Flock cameras around town.

All but invisible, these cameras are positioned at the backs of the drivers who pass by. Most of the time they are adorned with a solar panel, and have one or two bricks concealed beneath it. The camera itself is a vulnerable-by-design Android device.

(It amuses me that the Unitary Executive needs us to believe that renewable power is a waste with no economic payoffs, while the implementation of a mass ALPR surveillance network runs exclusively on solar. ICE is powered by the sun.)

This local officer made multiple mistakes that day. His mistakes were not the illegal kind, but he assisted me more than he intended. By pulling up to my position on the roadside, where I tapped the old license plate on my chest, pointed at the camera and mimed a spyglass at oncoming cars, this officer graduated my display from mere irreverence to A Problem.

Without me saying much of anything, he started talking about No Expectation Of Privacy and about the 4th Amendment. I hadn't challenged him at all on this points, but he had done enough thinking about it in advance that these arguments were on his lips before they were on mine.

Across this country, more than Flock cameras infest our streets and highways. The federal government covets the secrecy of these ALPR networks. The Flock network is ostensibly public, because there is No Expectation Of Privacy for a device mounted to a pole.

This officer said the cameras were public, but I told him I thought not, given that the city whoever that is systematically denies our Colorado Open Records Act requests by categorizing them as a criminal justice query.

This man offered to answer my questions about the Flock cameras, then dodged my questions. I told him that I had noticed some Flock cameras being put up on a temporary basis without a solar panel, pointing into neighborhoods. A camera like this was the very first that I traipsed in front of, in a Mario hat, thick red half cape and an old license plate on my chest.

I asked him how often they move around, because my metadata says that they can move around as often as 7-9 days. Perhaps the lone brick strapped to the pole was a battery that the police let run dry before collecting the device.

This officer is a henchman for a Big Tech boss he's never met and cannot name.

### Probable Cause

Border Patrol operates with impunity. Federal agents can sting anyone they want by inventing conjecture from the comfort of their concealed vehicle while they watch us drive and use AI to predict where we go and go we go there to see.

With hearsay on their lips, they call marks and targets. When they pull over a car for any one of the litany of Legal Reasons they have amassed over the decades, they can pivot their accusation and keep you pinned down until Border Patrol arrives from their digital lookout nest. Should you not have contraband as they proposed, they can say that the money you carry is suspicious. (Perhaps they think you should stick to bank and credit cards, where data brokers sell you like candy to anyone at all.)

The very vehicle you drive can be called a fruit of this hearsay crime. The less the police find, the more suspicious they can act.

The lack of evidence is their evidence. They dig deeper. They take you to court. They try to seize everything for a doctrine of Just In Case.

The lack of privacy is not a matter of what is public: All private companies circumvent the 4th Amendment by trivially choosing to sell the data that they take from us (having captured all facets of public life). These companies sell whatever they can. It's in their Terms. The derivatives of your data are the primary marketplace raison d'être. They carve out all future opportunity that they have not thought to name, and conceal the meaning of the ones they do name.

As I told the local officer, they can say National Security like a magic password and take anything they want, whether or not the data wears a price tag. It goes for local, but it goes for federal.

The government whoever that is has pivoted cyber warfare from a defense game to an intrusion game. The NSA is so irrelevant that I would not be surprised to hear soon that it is gutted and defunct, because what they do is so complicated compared to the ease of intrusion.

With toy devices strapped to the poles in every city in this country, AI agents are prowling everything you do, and the federal government whoever that is has decided to break open the reserves of all private data to allow promiscuous cross-checking of anything they want. Your credit history is among the items they can have at will.

Warrants and probable cause are expired concepts when the companies infesting our lives are willing participants in mass surveillance. When data is stolen, companies pay pitiful fines, the company's survival a given.

### The Corporate Death Penalty

We made companies into "People", empowering them with expansive rights like us. We did this for their comfort. Their speech is money, their brain swappable for any reason. No act committed by a company can be interrogated, no individual culpable.

Companies write wildcard Privacy and Terms policies that protect every iota of their own data, while they engage in a sustained attack on ours. They call Our Data theirs, and they claim we entered into some agreement.

An agreement is not a one-party decision, yet the same say that You regularly agree to terms you have never seen, by companies you have never heard of.

AT&T plays games with words to say that their obligation is only to "record" your consent. They have no interest in soliciting you for it, so they use private heuristics to stand as proxy for your consent. Usually, it's simple enough for them to say that your next phone upgrade Constitutes Your Consent to new programs that not even the ground agents know the names of.

Rent collusion is hurriedly waved away by multinational property managers, the individuals so confident that they personally are not doing the collusion. Our property managers wield our homes against like appreciating products, and vitally depend on the collusion software to recommend prices. To the property managers, rent increases are just a multiple choice quiz where the answers are provided by the collusion network. With the illusion of free will, our property managers think they make the decisions, while the only valid decisions are those prescribed by the collusion that was already accomplished with or without them. AI agents will soon take over their jobs, choosing the best increases without human factors.

We are in a period of history where AI agents are simultaneously responsible for what they do (copyright) and never responsible for what they do (algorithm).

Have you ever tried sending a Colorado Privacy Act letter to an AI agent claiming to be a real and actual agent of the company who pays for their digital labor?

I have.

Do you think these agents are responsible agents, or are they irresponsible agents? Are they legally representing the company they wear the names of, or are they just a loosely affiliated happy accident that sometimes brings in business?

Are they agents or are they agents?

Companies are firing People across industries and disciplines, destroying the livelihoods of People in the greatest displacement of humanity we have yet to see.

Companies whatever those are have leveraged their Supposed Personhood to eclipse our actual personhood. They deploy mindless agents against us and claim no responsibility for what happens next, though they want the benefits of everything that does happen.

Companies are the original impersonators of Personhood, and yet they are wholly unaccountable the way we are. They cannot go to prison. (Their executives can't either, but that's its own problem.)

Are companies immune to probable cause, or just us humans? Can we seize their things when they are uncooperative? Can the lack of evidence be cited as a reason to torment them into losing everything they have?

Companies have plot armor. The old philosophy of being Too Big To Fail is not even at issue. Any company is **Too Precious To Fail.**

When a nationwide network of rent collusion is found out, they pay pennies on the wealth they stole from us and then weaponized against us to raise the prices higher. They pay so-called fines, or more likely negotiate their way out of such payments before they are ever delivered.

When a social media network loses or sells data it shouldn't, they distribute a say-nothing PR post proclaiming all the virtues we just witnessed them failing to use, and then go back to plotting how to do it again.

When a credit agency suffers a data breach, they send us emails (does Gen Z even use email much?) offering us company scrip for services they say can help with that.

When a local government partner like Park Mobile acquires a new undisclosed partner giving them new escalating capabilities with your data and its derivatives, they only make you push a colorful Agree button, so that you can park at the the meter you're already in front of.

**There Are No Penalties At All** for abusing us.

**There Is No Limit** to the disrespect they can engineer against us.

**There Are No Consequences.**

Because there is no fear At All over our regular and frequent abuse, it is intended, Designed and purposeful.

What would be the difference, I wonder, if there were literally any stakes at all? Do you believe a free market would encourage them to value their security and design?

If companies whatever those are want to be People, it must be the case that they can suffer consequences like us, be vulnerable to seizure like us.

Would the companies fear us if we could assign consequences that had any meaning at all?

### Destruction

(notes)

The 4th Amendment has been fully defeated by companies whatever those are.

We have incentivized monopoly in every form, approving virtually every anti-competitive merger that has ever crossed the desk of regulators. When a deal is at risk, it is just a show, a stickemup for someone to pay someone for the privilege (and that someone is never us).

We have done this by reasoning that anti-competitive behaviors don't touch the mythical asymptote of monopoly. Because the monopoly is not complete against us, it is therefore allowed and encouraged. And it is lucrative, especially for the lawyer class, who have more Privilege in their typing fingers than any one of us will ever enjoy in our entire lives.

#### Disgorgement

(notes)

More than mere penalties, we must be powerful enough to take back what they stole from us. This is complicated by the fact that these companies have already spent our money paying their executives and their underlings. The fast reinvestment of our wealth for the compounding attack is a primary feature of the complexity.

The companies whatever those are will surely argue that giving value back to us endangers real jobs and People, while they are relentless in their attack on ours. They fire us en masse, and owe us no explanation. They steal from us en masse and owe us no explanation.

It is time for an explanation. For Once In Their So-Called Lives they must be made to account for their piracy of us.

#### Disclosure

(notes)

There is no rational way to fight back against wildcard Terms and the corpus of policy documents that no single human can comprehend. These must be destroyed outright. It must not be possible to reserve untramplable rights while every right we call our own is Encumbered.

#### Disincentive

(notes)

Move Fast And Break Things used to be a sexy slogan in tech companies. They realized that we live in a regulation desert. They knew there were no consequences before we did.
