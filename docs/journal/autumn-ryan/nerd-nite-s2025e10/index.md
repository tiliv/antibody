Wolverine Farm The Publick House is a great location. It has history, and books.

This panel is a little different than the others I've attended lately, but Andres's face is familiar. I know a little of what he'll be talking about tonight, because he let me approve one of his slides.

The Bosses here at Nerd Nite are as these:

- Justin Fritz
- Senne Van Loon
- Hannah Bauer
- Jamie Fritz

In 2003, Chris Balakrishnan was studying Indogobird as part of his doctorate at Boston University. An NYC event began, and the rest is history (that I can barely abridge because they're going through it fast!)

### Chris Pruneski

#### Fashion-ism

_Historical and Political Influence on Societal Expression_
