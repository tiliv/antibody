Wolverine Farm The Publick House is a great location. It has history, and books.

This panel is a little different than the others I've attended lately, but Andres's face is familiar. I know a little of what he'll be talking about tonight, because he let me approve one of his slides.

The Bosses here at Nerd Nite are as these:

- Justin Fritz
- Senne Van Loon
- Hannah Bauer
- Jamie Fritz

In 2003, Chris Balakrishnan was studying Indogobird as part of his doctorate at Boston University. An NYC event began, and the rest is history (that I can barely abridge because they're going through it fast!)

#### Fashion-ism

_Historical and Political Influence on Societal Expression_

"History (why did anyone invent bras anyway?)"

Clothing has been around for as long as we can trace our fully lineage. 800,000 years ago, we have furs and leathers with tool marks in them.

Warmth was paramount during the Ice Age. 19,000 years ago, the ice went away in force.

Complex garment have to form-fit around your body. These show up by 40,000 BCE. They needed to be sewn, have cut pieces from larger sheets of material, fastened, etc.

We have evidence of homospaiens in regions where the cold would have made it impossible to survive without complex clothing.

The genetic diversification of head lice coincides with human migration.

#### Abundance of Artistry

Fashion appears with dyes. New technology for clothing, like weaving, growing flax for linen, cotton, sheep farming and breeding. By 30,000 BCE, we see turquoise, pink, black dyed flax fibers.

Beads become sewn onto items, and buried that way. Ivory was used.

Tattoos become visible as well. Scans show Pazyryk tattooist probably used several tools on a woman's arm.

Scarification is likely to have appeared here too.

Cultural exchange lead to the establishment of the Silk Road trade route. ~300 BCE to mid 1400s. Chinas establishes it, the Ottomans ended it via boycott. Exchange of silks, linens, cotton, batik, screenprints, clothing styles from far and wide.

#### Fashion as Language

_"Talk shirt-y to me!"_

This becomes a self expression. Strong examples are Japanese clothing and tattoos. Even now-extinct groups like Ainu had a style of fashion. Other strong groups include Matadors, native Moroccans.
- Embroidery styles are very rich in the pictures she's showing us. I can't describe them much with any justice. They are vivid and diverse.

Exploiting Cultural Authenticity. Why does fashion matter in culture?

We start to see the concept of appropriation in modern times. Signs of parody, coding of good and bad.

The Frankenstein movie is a very fashion-forward film, serving the character storytelling.

#### Fashion as Status Quo

Who determines what is in Vogue? What "should" you wear? As things goes in cycles, things come into clear phases of demand and rejection.

Mass-produced cars instantly changed the way clothing was used. Hemlines get much longer when times are hard.

#### Fashion as Rebellion

Counter-culture arises. Monoculture diverges.

> Hitler hated red lipstick. He thought it was for SLUTS!

Freddie Mercury is impossible not to mention here.

#### Fashion as Stigma

- Mesh
- Red bootlaces
- Zootsuit
- Dewrags
- Tattoos as a prison indicator
- Shaved heads, workboots
- Holocaust tattoos (forced)
- Colored hair

> I bet she has pronouns!

It's funny.

#### Fashion and Dominance

Fashion reflects primary culutre, religion, expectations. It becomes a law of a kind.

Laws against wearing natural hair, shaved, cut. Western clothing has supplanted, more than become adopted naturally.

Marie Antoinnette was accused of acquiring a necklace (though she didn't) and she got killed for it. Vibes.

Mass production and enslaved labor.

40% of clothes are never worn.

Wages.

Consumerism: The Final Boss of Hyper-Capitalism

Microtrends are this extreme end of capitalism and consumerism. It moves faster faster faster faster.

Clothes are getting cheaper.

(insert picture of Gahana beach.)

A beach in Ghana is full of clothes that have washed up.

Imitation is flattery. We see only a snippet of of the lives of people, and fashion is dense with the way it communicates to us. Self-image, how you appear. Body shape, style, hair color. "To change your life, you need to have what I have."

#### The Makeover.

Desire.

#### The Hunger.

Diet culture is a spectrum. Ozempic Chic. Keto, Paleo.

#### 21 Forever.

Cosmetic plastic surgery is a form of ashion. Augmentation, vanity. Noses.

Mormon-adjacent plastic surgery culture.

#### The way you dress.

It indicates who you are, which in-groups you are part of. Your morals, your sexuality. Laces and hats and anything.

> You can tell who these people if you just look at their clothing.

(She admits she lives and breathes this stuff, but she's right, even if you don't have words for the things we see in the collage photo.)

Don't let anything--internet or body shape--dictate what you wear.

YOLO. Support your community.

#### Q&A

**Favorite style?** Victorian stuff.

**Any underrated colors in history.** Brown gets a bad rap but it doesn't wash things out and mixes well.

**Politically, having more business-shaven clothes on planes.** That's dumb because not everyone is flying for business. (I think the idea is that this forces culture via clothing. She discusses colonialism as performing this role.)

**Do you see the rise of conservatism influencing fashion?** Hemlines, (tradwife), Reaganism and feminized silhouettes, high necklines, long sleeves, hyper skinny feminine form. The banality of evil expressed in conservative fashion.

**What's the periodicity of fashion as a top-down cycle?** Fashion is picked by people and trickles down. (I believe this trickle-down more than any monetary policy version of that phrase.)

**What is the significance of the 80s/90s neons?** Part of this very exciting and bright era of American culture, where people were excited to be Americans again. Huge patterns, vivid colors.

**Is there a band or an artist you'd love to have wear one of your creations?** Would love to dress Chappel Roan, she's got a really great butt.

**What has been the most impractical fashion trend?** Venician women in the 1200s would wear these insane platform shoes so that their long gowns would not drag in the road and the maneur. Things that get used don't survive, things that don't get used survive instead. (Survivorship bias story, very interesting way to use this.)

> I know a lot of stupid stuff about a lot of stupid shit.

(I love her.)
