> <u>Minna Song</u> is the co-founder and <u>CEO of EliseAI</u>,
a company using advanced natural language processing to automate communication across the multifamily industry—and beyond.

> Originally launched as "Meet Elise"
the company powers <u>AI leasing agents</u> for over 350 customers
including <u>70% of the 50 largest rental housing operators in the U.S.</u>

> but Song’s vision goes <u>far</u> beyond leasing.

> `she thinks real estate is` finally waking up
to first-principles `product design`.

> That is, more <u>multifamily operators</u> are taking tasks
that have historically been completed by team members on-site,
<u>moving</u> them <u>off-site to centralized offices</u>, whether here, Or <u>Offshore</u>.

> What are our thinking (sic) about <u>the hierarchy of needs</u>, right?

> How can we maximize our impact in this world?

> It's food, water, and shelter. And so <u>we picked shelter</u>.

> **Brad Hargreaves:** `Is the AI pounding on the door saying, "You gotta pay?"`

> **Minna Song:** `It is`, which is a great task.

> I think AI and centralization go hand in hand.

> So a lot more people are starting to <u>adopt this autopilot model of operations</u>.
