**The proliferation of drone technology in our skies will lead us to ambiguity and violence.**

**Denver Police Department has acquired police drones in a free promotional capacity**, and Flock is launching a Drone As First Responder program in Our State.

> Denver joins a growing number of metro area communities using drone as first-responder programs, including Commerce City and Castle Rock.

> DPD said it is <u>currently piloting with Skydio Drone, and has signed a contract with Flock Aerodome</u>, the same surveillance company at the center of recent controversy over a contract extension it made with the city <u>behind closed doors</u>, according to some Denver City Council members.

> A move that is apparently starting to become <u>a pattern</u> for the city.

> When Denver7 reached out to Denver Councilmember At-Large <u>Serena Gonzalez-Gutierrez</u>, she <u>said this was the first she had heard about DPD's drone pilot program.</u>

> And <u>as a member of the city's surveillance task force</u>, she believes <u>the community should have been involved in the decision</u> to launch the pilot program back on Oct. 18.

**In greater than 30% of cases, the police deemed the drone intimidation to be sufficient.**

**These drones whoever they are will be weaponized and given lethal force options. Until then, they will be allowed to perform target selection and force recommendations.**

Tech startups are offering digital AI weapons to our police `for free`.

**Police Departments are cutting these private deals without oversight, and without notification to any public servant.**

**Governor candidates in This State must contemplate the threshold of abuse** that will rise to the level of requiring the restart of the `Colorado State Defense Force`. The governors will be caucusing around the time that the Skydio trial contract ends and a purchasing cycle begins. They will be too late, but they can erect a system of defense for us.

**We are not policed by our own. We are policed by private tech firms.** Their insidious privacy policies allow them to keep drone footage "unrelated to investigations" for two months. This kind of language, meant to limit liability, is endlessly turned against us for the securement of novel and broad undocumented capabilities. They will have impunity to harass us without any open investigation at all.

**Drone violence is on our doorsteps.**

**We must secure authorization for ourselves to destroy these autonomous invaders on sight,** lest they think they can perform target selection on individuals without police oversight.

**We must secure the training, dispatch and means to defend ourselves**, because our legislatures, city councils and department chiefs are powerless or conspire against us.

**Governors: Your constituents desire the power to defend themselves, because our police are tireless in their goal to abdicate their power to consumer-grade military tech startups without oversight.**

The Governor of Colorado has the power to form and direct a state defense force without the National Guard, which SCOTUS has proven can be captured by the Department of War and dispatched across state lines.

**Our State must resume its defense force immediately.**
