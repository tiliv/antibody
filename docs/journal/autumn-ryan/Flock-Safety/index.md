### Flock Safety
We in the area of Fort Collins are watched by numerous devices. Sometimes they let you have data about you. Sometimes they don't. It might not be obvious which response is better; Should you hope they can precisely tag you and extract you with haste? Should you hope they even know how, or how to verify who's asking?

#### Drones as First Responders

Flock has been initiating zero-cost projects with cities which supply the police drones using unsupervised AI to race to alleged crime scenes.

In some cases, Flock technology seems distributed alongside Skydio's technology.

Both programs solicit the use of their unvetted technology to police departments, for free, without the knowledge of any elected public servant.

You should anticipate the lethal arming of these drones in the future, and for technology algorithms to authorize target selection.

You should also be aware that we have over two decades of precedent that says Algorithms Don't Hurt Anybody.

#### Dashcams

Flock technology has been found to operate in consumer-grade dashcams, without knowledge or disclosure to anyone.

They are spying on you, peering through your own eyes, and you've never even read their "Privacy" Policy.

How much longer will it take you to realize that Privacy Policy is an oxymoron?
