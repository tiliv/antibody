      “Are there other groups that you can think of?” a reporter asked.
    - |
      "We have some pretty `radical groups`, and they `got away with murder`."
    - |
      "`They come in a beautiful new car.` They’re so proud and `it’s Border
      Patrol, ICE, you know`, it’s got whatever it is, and they’re throwing
      rocks at it. And after 50 yards, it looks like an old, beat up
      vehicle. It was just brand new. `It was just bought for the purposes`,
      and they don’t have to take that anymore."
    - |
      “`I say when they spit, you hit.` Do whatever you want. `You do
      whatever the hell you want`,” Trump told reporters.

    - A man is sitting in the driver's seat of a vehicle, looking intently out the open window. He's wearing `camouflage` clothing, a `dark cap`, and a `green cloth covering` the lower half of `his face like a mask`. His right arm is extended toward the camera, `holding a handgun`, which he appears to be `aiming directly` outward. The vehicle looks like a light-colored truck or SUV. `The focus` of the image is the man's intense gaze and `the gun pointed toward the viewer.`

      As The Gateway Pundit reported, Senators Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and
      Mark Kelly of Arizona, along with Representatives Chris DeLuzio of
      Pennsylvania, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of
      New Hampshire, and Jason Crow of Colorado, posted a video on Tuesday
      `essentially ordering` these professionals to betray Trump and implement
      `a ‘soft coup,’` rendering him powerless to carry out his policies.
    - |
      A furious Trump `called the video “seditious”` and stated that these “traitors” should be arrested.
    - |
      It’s called `SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR` AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these `traitors to our Country` should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.
      <br>
      Their words cannot be allowed to stand – `We won’t have a Country anymore`!!! `An example MUST BE SET`. President DJT

      After `the murder of Renee Good`, this puppy-killing and plasticized bag of fascism gave a press conference saying the Good shooting was a good shoot. Botox (Klaus) Barbie `proclaimed Renee a domestic terrorist`.

      `We saw Ross execute her, and we heard him call her a “Fucking bitch” after doing so.`
    - |
      Thousands more were arrested and tortured. The fucking Nazis wrongly believed the assassins had come from Lidice, and so its population was to be wiped from the face of the earth. On June 9, 1942, five days after Heydrich died of his wounds, Nazis began a round up in the village. The next day, the killing began.
    - |
      The events in Czechoslovakia in 1942 are but one example of how the fucking Nazis reacted with extermination of “all of yours” when “one of ours” was killed. This is the mentality that ICE and the DHS is threatening to adopt should people `dare to resist the American Gestapo`.
