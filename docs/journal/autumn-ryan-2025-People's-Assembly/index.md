### Preamble

#### Rabbi Rachel Kobrin

We are not here to give Thoughts and Prayers.

#### Rosemary Othmer Pesko

Worked at Denver Health. We do not treat people as God's Beloved. The dignity of access.

#### Why Are You Here?

We filled out index cards that describe why we as individuals are here today.

The woman next to me is mourning the loss of a member of her family, for reasons connected to services in this state.

We are here to help along a more humane and just society. Where there is light there is hope.

This morning at another location, Rev. Gretchen Haley recited similar words: Where there is love there is hope.

#### Roll Call

We are using a technology called Mentimeter to do live audience polling.

- This technology with face competition from me in 2026. It is centralized and used for live interactive presentations. It's fine, but it's not sufficient. It pitches itself as a word cloud maker, among other things.
