### Preamble

#### Welcome & Credential

Neither Enemies Nor Allies Are Permanent.

#### Invocation

**Rabbi Rachel Kobrin**: We are not here to give Thoughts and Prayers.

#### Relational Activity

**Rosemary Othmer Pesko**: Worked at Denver Health. We do not treat people as God's Beloved. The dignity of access.

#### Why Are You Here?

We filled out index cards that describe why we as individuals are here today.

The woman next to me is mourning the loss of a member of her family, for reasons connected to services in this state.

We are here to help along a more humane and just society. Where there is light there is hope.

This morning at another location, Rev. Gretchen Haley recited similar words: Where there is love there is hope.

#### Roll Call

We are using a technology called Mentimeter to do live audience polling.

- This technology with face competition from me in 2026. It is centralized and used for live interactive presentations. It's fine, but it's not sufficient. It pitches itself as a word cloud maker, among other things.

(insert word cloud)

#### Collective Moment We're In

**Meghan Carrier**: We needed more power in the hands of people. House meetings and listening parties began before we knew who the next President in this country would be.

Cognitive empathy, to listen and believe someone's experience, when it is different than ours. It leads us to take action. In this posture, we are called to be curious and listen deeply, while remaining Whole ourselves.

> In the face of the fire of injustice, I have seen <u>laborers of love deliver us</u>. Revolutionary Love is the choice to enter into labor, <u>for others</u> who do not look like us, <u>for our opponents</u> who hurt us, <u>and for ourselves</u>. `In this era of enormous rage``, when the fires are burning all around us, I believe that `revolutionary love is the call` of our times.

**Sharon Battle**: The board president of Together Colorado.

Together, we rise in love and strength. These moments are not new to us; we have weathered storms before.

We will come through stronger, and this one too. We've come this far by faith. We won't turn around. We've come this far by faith.

Wehther you draw strength from sacred texts, community or resilience within, we are here together.

Some of us gather in places of worship; Some in living rooms; Some in silence.

We have shown up here today, with compassion and love.

We can listen when someone is hurting; We can feed someone when they are hungry; We can visit someone when they are sick or lonely.

Whatever the circumstance, joy or sorrow, abundance or need, love is our foundation.

**`Together`** `We Rise`.

#### 2025 Accomplishments

**Ilana Steinberg**: A member of the board of Together Colorado.

It has been a painful year. (I will note that Together Colorado helped compel our senator to enact the shutdown that harmed us so.)

There have been many gatherings. At the state level, there were over 150 participants in the legislative lobbying day. Family visitation is a right for those who are incarcerated. Passed a bill to study a universal healthcare plan.

(insert picture of "a better option" card)

In Boulder County: initiative 1B, funding for mental health services.

In Louisville: defeated bill to prevent affordable housing.

In Lakewood: expand housing options.

In Denver: defeated backroom agreement between the city and Xcel energy.

In Colorado Springs: defeated a camping ban that would have criminalized the unhoused.

New organizing efforts in many more cities and towns.

Many day-long trainings for leaders, over 400.
