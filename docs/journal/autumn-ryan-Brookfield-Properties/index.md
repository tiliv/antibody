### Notes

- On the morning of October 16, I was contacted by an LLM with an unsolicited message.
- An LLM exactly like the First State Auto Group's Impel.ai
- Only this time it's hording my financial metadata and contact information from the outset, because EliseAI is their CRM.
- The CEO of EliseAI (previously: Meet Elise) proclaims that all multifamily housing operations in America should be offshored and centralized for her industry outsider efficiency kink.

- When I confronted the office staff (within actual minutes of the unsolicited LLM contact), they had an easier time pulling it up than First State Auto Group, and didn't struggle to identify the LLM's contact with me.
- They admit this one is called Elise.
- They want to know what my problem is, so that they can wave their hand and give an empty explanation.
- I asked who named it (as it tradition), and yet again, I have found that no one is capable of speaking about these Agents as anything other than a fully autonomous hoaxes of humanity.
  - It works this way precisely because the services are being sold to the property managers the exact same way: The entire point is to set and forget.
- When I supplied the questions I wanted to ask, she was not ready for how many, and how specific they were. I will have to provide my questions to her directly, because she did not write a faithful version down for her notes.
- She did not comprehend my issue with consent.
- These people are wholeheartedly convinced that ambushing you with an opt-in attack, and then being upset and opting out, is the gold standard for "consent".
- In a previous adventure, this property manager group put flyers on our doors for a business that does not even exist in our town. They sold us out within weeks of ownership transfer.
  - When I brought this past incident up, she intoned that it was unfair because they'd quit doing it.
  - As if we can't tell how much you disrespect our Privacy in the first place.
- I have moved across this country, and one hundred percent of my homes have been snatched up by these companies, no matter where I go, no matter who owns my unit.

- She seems to believe that because these software systems are national, that's an out for them at the personal level (???).
  - But this is exactly the problem I'm highlighting. She don't have half the control she feigns. And if she does, it's being weaponized for financial motives.
  - Oh, how all the cogs are so innocent, so so innocent.
- They have no tangible control over their rent software, other than to nudge prices within a range.
  - She no doubt believes me to be confused when I call what they do "patently offensive", as though I'm accusing them of doing an overtly illegal thing right this second.
  - The fevered rush to say it's legal is amusing: yes, yes it is, and you are weaponizing it against us all.
- When she tried to eject the conversation into "it's a state issue", I was more than happy to tell her I'm working to meet state leadership, including the running candidate Phil Weiser for Governor of Colorado. Presently, he is AG, and is doing small group sessions in NoCo before year's end.
- When I asked if she knew whether the group which owns us is actively looking for more properties (since they didn't own us until just a few months ago either), there was zero coherent reply.
  - Surely buying more properties is profitable, right?
  - Riiiight?
  - Who Is Next?
- When I pressed to know if she knew of other properties which were NOT at risk of being bought up by our masters, she replied: "Anywhere but here."
  - In awe, I just left.

- I spent an hour walking around the property talking to my fellow residents, just enjoying some conversation. Who knows if we talked about EliseAI. Who knows.

**I will try to make You illegal**, and Your insatiable capture of Our Homes, the whole nation over. You drive up our prices without remorse so that you can spend your capital on hoaxes to run against us, and then feign your helplessness.

**You Sold Us With Enthusiasm.**

**For what? So that you don't have to do Your Job?**

**You won't have a job, once these Agents are through with you.** Even Minna Song thinks so.

I have scheduled both a live demo with EliseAI, and a return meeting with the property management.

### Questions

Given that this LLM is fundamentally unknown to all residents and does not expressly identify its nature when it instigates contact autonomously, my questions are these:

1. On what date was my personally identifiable information (PII) first given to the LLM?
2. At what frequency does the LLM receive updates to our PII?
  - If the LLM is the source of truth and does not need async updates, that's important to know.
3. Why did the LLM reach out to me
4. What decision-making powers are enumerated for the LLM?
5. Can the LLM make decisions without your foreknowledge?
6. What does your database schema allow you to track about me?
7. Have you read the EliseAI Privacy Policy?
8. Who makes digital service purchases for the property?
9. If EliseAI suffers a data breach, what is your responsibility to protect my privacy, if any?
10. Can EliseAI resell derivative metadata about me to its own partners?
11. Where are you most likely to work after they fire you for being less efficient than an LLM?
