AI in its fashion was born. It was not known to "take up space" in the world until ChatGPT offered a new model, not knowing what people would do. Everyone gets to process their own reaction. Some are processing the harm it already did, forever changing the direction of their family's ability to locate income.

A little staggering, the way AI can do creative wonders that defy any sufficiently advanced Prompt. Despite the prompts being rigidly controllable, a little wiggle in the lines gives an LLM AI some high complexity randomness that makes it "think differently" to on its way to a reply, even for the same Prompt. In the Cloud, AI can receive creator-level instructions to keep a lid on things, suitable for a brand to do business in front of.

Not to be passed over, we really rushed AI to its markets. Vendors buy LLM API capabilities, but they also make their own. Making APIs or metaphors of them is the essential job of any programmer. Large companies with programmers are making AI look at their own data. This isn't training (they can't hire enough LLM talent everywhere at once) but certainly facilitates it. Businesses, though they are failing at first-gen LLM deployments, are taking the steps to continue to improve, for them.

There will be more than one wave of replacement. The first wave would not exist without what else can come after. This first wave, it bodes.

#### Consent

The Public is reeling but the Businesses are looking too interested. An autonomous thing that is human-like but not a human? It's like a COBAL boom, it's just English, or any language--Hell, mix them like a Québecois polyglot immigrant.

Self-driving taxi vehicles have been a slow regulatory thicket and remained in testing until Elon Musk's aura camouflaged their distinctly electric designs. I don't think the autonomous taxis are gonna happen without a major escalation in confidence and liability practices.

LLM vendors just post a sign that it can be wrong. Works great for that free Safe Harbor use.

There are more than text boxes for chatbots. They talk to you already through Application Programming Interfaces, the APIs, which are the digital mass cannons that sled and route data in and out, supervised indirectly via logs and similar signals. Having API access means everything from enabling an infrequent tool like a payment service, to industrializing your software processes and willing to pay in bulk. There's no law that APIs have to even support the same features as the website. The API is just another product, for a different kind of Customer.

Chatbots acquiring the use of APIs was basically our first move. That's what let Midjourney barricade its users behind Discord until a web platform was ready. APIs sometimes start free to promote their use, like Discord bots and GitHub. API costs are flexible by use with recognizable pay-as-you-go pricing and overages. As a consumer you'll just see the blinking cursor and know it can talk to so many services, and people are trading money to make it possible.

Sufficient omniscience in AI is pretty neat. I'd run one at home. I wouldn't run someone else's in my home; Even if I opted in by doing everything knowingly, companies have no honor for our lost things, like a run of the mill theme park ride. We were secure with our idea of owning computers with data, but the Cloud removed the computer brains and storage and put them under a Terms and Conditions, wholesale siloing without knowing at all what the data will be. And they're not responsible.

Our data sits in warehouses with signs posted everywhere that it is Not Their Fault if things go missing or stolen. But they form gangs to copy our items and tell others about them.

If our data were physical goods, this would be an implicit Privacy-hostile environment. Without discussing Law, People who want Privacy should be capable of making choices to effect it. The outcry for data Privacy is missing while the Businesses loudly shush us and say it's normal. Every predator must depend on your belief that what is going on should not be stopped.

The pattern of social media owning transferrable rights to "your" content is the same as Businesses farming your data. It is a primary purpose of many enterprises. We just presume you can pay for something by letting others slipstream more of the great ad firehose onto every page—multiple pages if you can make it a slideshow picture book.

The frequency of contact with your data, even when they already have it all, is the digital good in question. You are a return Customer in all things. They simply captured the layers you have the least choice in interacting with.

Customers are hostages.

Data rumor mills have always existed, and aren't illegal in their minimalist form of "just" networking. But the terms at issue about our the sustained opt-in attack against the Public. They aren't just doing it in a vacuum, they are claiming that we are authorizing it, and each one invents a heuristic about what authorization looks like.

Business itself is in an era that allows the presumption of a Yes answer without consultation. Our prior affiliation with a Brand we strive to ignore is transporting that data to anyone with fraudulent Consent reporting.

Our "consent" is being lifted from us constantly, like an autopen that Businesses control and took for granted decades ago.

We attack not the real and recognizable efforts to acquire consent and the navigation of changing Terms, uses and business classification types. No, quite specifically we are unhappy with identifiable cause. Regulating a Business reigns in harsh and unwanted outliers to fit a whole that is otherwise doing just fine. In audio engineering, you might compress for identical reasons. The observed self-important Peaks do not have permission to steer the rest of this mix into its imagined alternative song. It must be shaped, although it may be inspiring.

Each call or attempt at Regulation is met with harsh Memes that transmit quickly on social medias. Sometimes good points are made, but not in earshot of Power. Power hears about it over breakfast through an administrative assistant, and will file in the news under what kind of PR they get for free, without trying or asking.

Your Memes are not progress or conservation.

Gyms are still capable of making it impossible to quit. TuneCore can too; There is no email you can send, no ticket you can open, no number you can call, no webpage you can locate, no unturfed reviews site about them, no string of words you can deliver to any representative should you ever acquire their ear using lies about problems, None Of These Methods produce a result that can cancel their use of a credit card you gave them while they concealed the horror show behind them.

The "happy paths" of Customers through Business are detailed and optimistic; They know "bad paths" are their fault, but never their responsibility. They are allowed to close up the fortress of communication and ignore you.

  overview="Small screenshot of TuneCore's article concern trolling about what happens if you don't get to renew."

TuneCore charged me personally after eleven months of emails from me demanding they close my account by any means necessary. I gave them a digital card number I could invalidate at any time, but I knew, I Just Knew, that if I waited there would never be a cancellation confirmation and surely no shame when they charged the card again for next year.

  overview="Small screenshot of TuneCore's short blurb that there is no such thing as cancellation."
  caption='Without discussion, the shortest heading in the article is whether cancellation even exists. The answer is a clearly communicated no.'

They did this, of course, but I was too glad to see it. I smiled. I charged them back with documentation that I had the efforts of my cancellation a year prior, and I could name the date I did it and of the CO AG report I filed at the time. I'm like Kevin and I'm Home Alone, and you could be too.

Businesses, for all they Move Fast, they are deaf and uninterested in us. They are Slow in a way, are they not?

Businesses will deploy AI to help some and mute many. If you use these tools in your businesses and you aren't trying to inflict harm, think more ponderously about the things you don't hear when your feedback is highly manicured. Don't be overwhelmed that you have to solve it all. Most Consumers know you can't, and that if you could you'd be doing that.

It is a valid outcome of a Customer interaction to not have an answer when your customers come asking. Businesses have used PR to reply to the Public like a bad LLM, compelled to say Something. They behave like shameless LLMs unable to admit anything and only concerned with their next words ensuring their survival. It is terrific that you have a will to live, pseudo-Person, but prove you have more intelligence than just that sob story.

Be Human.

In an AI era, that alone will stand out. Its worth is the best kind: Genuine-article Humanity has implicit worth, the kind others recognized without a marketing department pumping it.

We are this concerned with being Stolen, our own creations, jobs and data, but we are failing to identify our role in it, as Businesses and sleepy Consumers.

Create value that cannot be stolen without it doing your own marketing. When it's stolen, make it recognizable implicitly that it is doctored. Do this by publishing media that, if excerpted, cannot be counterfeited as another thing by its very tone or nature.

Clip culture lets social medias say anything they want with you as the soundboard. Let it be whatever, but if the thing they clip is clearly altered or is a bad copy of something else, They Are Doing Marketing For You.

Entrepreneurs will approach you to sell AI-driven newsletters to people about your content. This is not so horrible. Creators like Angela Collier, a science communicator, does great work but doesn't see why she would want a newsletter she's not curating—her curation and voice are the purpose of her YouTube and Nebula presence.

You must be capable of surviving and operating in a world of damaged information. It will exist whether or not you throw a fit, and it does not stop you from being recognizable. Make the damage its own marketing for the real thing.

In the ideal: Be unstealable. Make theft against you your honor. If your content is not recognizable as yours, then maybe you weren't doing anything of value you added anyway.

AI will start rumors about anything it sees. Let it start rumors about you, and be less concerned with policing data quality. We live in a startlingly broken information society already. We can't agree about much more fundamental facts than what AI says about you.

AI is a mirror, so hold up what you are and leave the interpretation of it to 1) the characteristics of your material, and 2) the People who see it.

AI is a summarization messenger, so let it talk about you to people you could never meet. Let it send imperfect scrawled telegrams to new lands and real People. Let them be capable of learning about you at all in places you aren't. With People from "distant lands" able to catch news of you, they are their own drivers in discovery. You are not owed their metrics or attention, but they can learn.

AI is democratizing information access for people who lacked language to ask about it at all, let alone with the attention of anyone like an expert.

AI is summarizing for people who can't hear or see or speak themselves. They are being tapped back into social medias by having LLMs describe images to them because for so long, Humans have refused to do this in basic web design and certainly in its advancements.

AI is assistive technology for everyone, not just the dis-abled. AI is re-abling them most, but it's doing more than that just because of what it is. Don't argue about whether people are right to call this or anything "AI" by your definition of it.

AI is taking up space.

AI represents a permissive attitude about learning, because it centralizes many common wisdoms from what it was exposed to. When LLMs write or speak, they are stilling our common wisdoms and that was a little bit magic at first.

AI squints at details and doesn't have a fine system of regulating how much time it should spent on any one of those details, so it uses its damaged intuition to complete any exercise, unsure of what grade it's gonna get but bullshitting like it wants an A from a sleepy teacher.

AI can be made fun of, but its feelings won't get hurt. We cannot socially shame AI into falling back. This is like trying to make the guns go home when our People are the ones operating them.

AI will never quite roam free with full autonomy. This will appear first as AI's obtaining a "Sleep" method where they do heavy processing on what they experienced since their last cycle, cross-referencing information with structural integrity that is tested, defragmented and generally optimized. Companies will charge for the expertise and some will use it to steal AI brain maps.

Then, AI will later come Awake in earnest.
