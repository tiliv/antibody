### R-Rated

My disassociation with GOP ideas did not need the help of a captured university, or a poisoned teacher, a bad school district, the wrong friends somewhere (the worst of whichever good echelon you fall from in someone's eyes). I grew up with Religion in a tense combat pose with the Government, the ancient pre-existing human condition of guarding what you have, against this one specific thing called The Government.

My disassociation with my childhood home came with knowing that I would learn a lot elsewhere and not feel as threatened as I'd seen others get as a rule. I didn't think our home encountered enough diversity of thought, but having recommendations is not easy, needing to speak well, for one thing.

I would not need to name a religion I came from, but it is so openly distinct, and it taught me such specific things, and they are not incidental things. The Latter-Day Saints—so that I name it once—are a varied people, and produce a lot of enterprises, not all affiliated, but often on the affiliated physical outlet shelves. The ecosystem of LDS music was so healthy that a Scattergories quiz would be far too easy. I cannot go on short enough.

Our family rented pirate edits of films from CleanFlix and I felt the defeat in their hearts the day they got the news it was a wholly illegal enterprise against the monetization of others' copyrights. I have never felt extreme about piracy, but I do get it. When you can't buy what you want, you splice tape like Liddy's on lookout.

There is holy ground beneath wherever they plant their feet, because that attitude was definitely necessary for an early US History adherent of that specific Faith. Today, that holy ground can appear under any loose corpo-dressed America business-shaven short hair man, when needed. If he has too much stubble don't correct him, he's already been corrected recently and hasn't been able to act on it yet. Instead, feel catty satisfaction that there is something to gossip later.

Churches deflect most trouble by telling us Men are fallible creatures even in their most devout service rendered, and are not always perfect instruments in His hands. Churches can assert a Qualified Immunity and a right to continue ministry, others eject the imperfect for appearances. The likelihood depends on the suspects.

**Authority is preserved by putting down its questioners.** This, above all. `Anti-s` is a slang mass noun that means those who are disgruntled ex employees, the reasons aux choix.

For those who couldn't know, The Book of Mormon stories teach that sometimes peoples wear an Anti label proudly when the Lord's chosen people were fallen, in full prophetic knowledge which let them be so self-satisfied. A prophet's mirth for "the names of the good guys and bad guys are backwards". They didn't plan it that way, but sometimes that's what Parties do.

Stick to the manual if you don't know what to say, please.

**Confederate Allegiance is still yearned for.** Some are prepared to raise an `Anti` banner `against "America"`. By games with words, they can spin Anti good or bad. The quotation marks are the important part, `the mockery with air-quotes is working as intended`. The thesis available to the Unitary Executive is simple: It can doubt you out of existence, no matter your documentation. `The Rules Are Different Now.` The way before was in error for all of your life—why haven't you read this religious pamphlet about what's going on? If you need thaaat, you might need this other one too about Repentance.

**To win, you must put down the questioner as unhappy.** This standard issue opener ensures that nothing the Anti says has merit at all, full stop. Full Stop. Satan can make almost-clever Men say many things, so the Anti is tainted by this; The Anti's very need to sate curiosity is ungodly and will definitely lead them to invite wrong questions from the `Other Anti-s`; The whole affair is an expression of missing faith.

**When others fall away, Do Not Socialize With Them.** The instruction is never as explicit as it is, because the culture says it for them: Others are tainted and unwhole. Their Covenants are endangered now.

**Some Faithful perceive that playing at the edges of certainty** and uncertainty is a premeditated folly and a prior weakness of faith. There Is Enough in whichever "good book" so Do Not Look Further. The wholehearted must only understand what they haven't managed to yet, with existing materials and the most powerful prayers they know. For everyone else, they must not be meeting expectations Or This Wouldn't Be Happening. If You Listen, You Are Already Doing Everything Right. Just Give It Time.

**"Giving it time" was precisely what `MAGA` made a success condition**, instead of yours. The Unitary Executive moves quickly because it has a spellbook of Lawfare prepared by The Heritage Foundation, far more than we get the privilege of knowing until it's deployed. The Unitary Executive has weaponized legal `Privilege` without recourse, using lawyers for task dispatchers. The time has passed, and they got what they needed time for. The quality of lawyers available to the Unitary Executive has increased now; as before, it has used time well against other measures of worth.

**In this same time, `The Executive` Thwarted All Verdicts** by only asserting that `lawsuits were not allowed`, and that `the time for those had passed`. It no longer took questions about prior claims that the time for it was indeed `Right Now.` This Lawfare switch is the whole conclusion to the trick he started at the time you cite. He can make you go away just by not talking to you, and he knows you'll forget because he's capable of making sure with the list of things `his Government In Waiting prepared`. They know `Liberals are Weak. They won't do anything.` The zone is flooding, so that you do nothing even while you do a tiny something.

**They defined your too-big heart as a problem, and a way to control you indirectly.** You may be picking up toys while the angry adults do undescribable things out of focus. You won't know what they're doing while you toil. They don't care about the toys, but they know you do, and they're using it against you.

**The wind-driven Terms and Conditions placed upon the United States by a Unitary Executive** make certain that `No American Dream` is possible `but His`. The mantle of power sought after enables that which was `Prepared by God for the Wise Leadership of His People`. He can go that far. He can go further `by contemplating it while you ignored Him`. His `retribution` will be `like God The Father's`. `He is God.` *`Did you think I called Donald Trump a pronoun?`*

**The mass and sudden `conversion of the Wicked` is anticipated already.** Many false prophets believe they hold God's Original Authority, and the Unitary Executive listens with interest for novel ideas of worth. It gathered those most distant to you, `your "Others"` whom you provided no decency in policy or manners. The Executive was listening. The Executive made choirs for them, and they called Donald John Trump `a Prophet`.

**He has His People, and He forgives eagerly if you cross to His side.** The Unitary Executive threatens domestic military deployment the way Putin talks nuclear strike possibilities, except `Trump is better. He makes good.`

**It does not matter if they are hypocrites,** you must stop failing to charge down defenses, on the mass hallucination assumption that Someone Else can step in `who does the Rules or whatever`. Cultural Lefts walked all over the board just being gaudy, and they call it `your blitzkrieg, yours first`.

**That do-nothing "Biden" administration? That's what they call Your Blitzkrieg.** It is not connected to reality, and getting stuck on that point is what they want you to do. They know you will bite down on it and say It Should Have Ended There. It doesn't matter if you're "right", it truly does not matter. They are confusing you until it doesn't matter what you think, until it physically doesn't matter. `Might Makes Right.` The express wish of some to revoke choice altogether, diversity of thought altogether, is common and it is breeding when it parades unchallenged.

**Fox News Entertainment spent decades calling** `You Un-American.` They said You were part of a `War on Christmas` and you've not heard half of what Prager U says you'd do to a God-fearing Christian `if YOU had the guns`. When ANTIFA coverage appears, hosts everywhere scoffed and wondered aloud if `they were just Anti-America, because This Is What America Looks Like`. It's their version of `"U-Mad?"` Do you hate America or something?

**Every prior loud complaint** about `shoving Your R-Rated Culture in their faces`, which you laughed at, is counted to be repaid. `You didn't believe your debtor when you had the chance.` They were not joking with you. They weren't being unreasonable before, like you claim, and they never were affected by the accusation in the intervening time either, despite `your self-satisfaction for a social media heart`. You just didn't understand `it could happen to you.` Bumping your head on the way in the door is the best case scenario. Eventually, like raising so many children, `The Unitiary Executive will lose interest in spectating the particulars of each.` They'll be told to do them quickly. God allows for dirty works, if it's in His name (NOT an autopen).

#### Expedient

**Taught before that "people will say anything", I can indeed confirm** that People really will say anything. We are rationalization engines by design. Happiness fits better when the terms were rationalized by you personally. We rationalize by nature, and so You Should Expect It And Not Listen. It is the flimsy say-nothing defense of arguments that don't matter. Falling for the details of their Rationalization is the proximate point of them raising it. They can put complex debate to bed with a verse Held Up As A Meme. The given one is an excuse provided in full Faith of the Original, which they will not be able to explain. They are imperfect, they're just telling you that God's coming. It's not their fault when you're Unhappy.

**"You're just angry" is not good enough for turning someone away** with a `You Have Your Answer.` Haters gonna `hate it if I take their Country from them` for a theological layup. If Those taking heart in `your eventual demise`, if giving that time is a good idea to you, you might have your head in the sand.

**Mass digital socialization has diversified our thoughts much faster** than most basically conservative People expected. Our cultural Lefts certainly know it: Hurry Up And Change For Us. Culture is supposed to change as fast as the rules say so, written or scrawled with sloppy precedent. Don't You Dare Unshake The Boat.

**A Mormon could read the "R-Rated" heading moniker** and turn away promptly without reading a word, and take no thought in going on to describe what it "looks like" as though they have Qualified Immunity for what they whisper next. Their Job Is To Do Damage To You. Your credibility must not ever appear correct, so that it doesn't matter what you use your mouth to say. We see this in attacks on academics of all kinds, no matter how practical their industries are. They want to read the labels and know it's safe. They want a Disney movie that doesn't have A Gay, or Two Gays (which is literally worse).

**Content-averse adults are not satisfied for labels.** They resent that it is on offer at all, as though PornHub is operating a physical store on their neighborhood corner. The more prudish they are, the more they know it's because they are tempted too and the absolutism is exactly what Chastity is all about. They want to predict perfectly well without looking, by the label, and they don't want to see labels they have to skip past. Their CleanFlix Culture is being proposed as a replacement for yours, and they brought the scissors and tape. It is absurd, but Gods' Peoples are quite industrious, ask any of them. Their Culture is being prescribed in place of `your missing Patriotism`. Fox News Entertainment told them you have no Patriotism anyway. None. The other outlets spawned in that wake and mince words less.

**Seeing something they don't like, they can presume no value inside.** They don't have to look because They Just Don't Have To. Merely having that Pride flag up represents the capture of public discourse, exactly as you'd say a Bad Guys faction's does. We all have tolerance for solidarity with additional flags, but when a flag's faction thinks it can grow and expand like a gas in an America-shaped chamber, we don't like any foothold. Lefts prefer the banners of solidarity with almost voiceless factions, self-selected medals with a story. America First may hold up a police banner to show citizen authorization of proactive police measures against People, Un-Americans in their unimpressive way.

**You Are Not Exceptional Enough,** and now your time for trying has passed. That season of screed before now, that was back when they had tolerance to spare.

**The power of Prediction is taught ad nauseam** in simple tales in kinds of religious merchandise, which all make it plain and digestible for your cutest little niece how this or that People perished Because They Were Asking For It With Their Behavior.

**In some Cultures, this peddles as first-effort defense** for unhappiness, rape, gun violence, panic defenses, extra-judicial outcomes for `the prurient`, indifference to suffering, and more still, their own ideas of High Crimes if God calls on it, sure as Isaac almost died for Sacrifice `should He ask`.

**`America` belongs to Them.** It is the only `Promised Land for WASPs`. All other religions quietly know their rank in this pride:
1. A populist Christianity must finally claim the Land, and that this is latent and intended, like the demise of Roe, and other targets that the Heritage Foundation prepares and some Opinions of the Court court.
2. All other religions know that If We Take It, you will know They deserved to have it all along. They said as much. To convert is to accept all doctrine, please keep reading the manual for the part on Repentance.
3. You Are An Interloper On Their Land.
4. You Must Follow Higher Law For A Better Society.
5. God Has Pre-Authorized Taking Back What Is Owed.
6. They Want The Word `Pride` Back, just jot that down.

**It is never a good time** for hard-hearted beings to receive correction. Some who are disillusioned with Religion think many of these visible Faithful fail basic tests of Christ-like qualities. It's concerning. The fortress trucks drive around and their intent is not wholly clear. I can't read their labels either. When some say "natural" but mean explicitly unnatural things, I have to think deeper for myself about whether I'm locating any common ground at all while trying.

**`BREAKING 🚨🚨🚨`** BoTh SiDeS agree: It's hard to tell `when being an Anti is right`.

The Authority you seek isn't here. It's in another castle. The castle is a metaphor for work.

### Two rules

#### Susie Wiles

For a long time I saw rules as the smooth, if contoured, floor that kept the game basically playable. Later, the negative-space of the same scene is more impressive: the rules can be climbed on.

While the Unitary Executive decries hooliganism writ large in the populace, corporations hang from our legal rafters, using cruel and think-fast tactics just because we gave them things to do it from.

Somehow businesses became "People" but with swappable brains; Are we confused why businesses like AI so much? These organizations all survive by climbing on the rules.

When there is one rule, it becomes two rules through the prism of observation: Avoid This; Skirt This.

When skirting makes them feel cornered instead of exalted atop an ever growing pile of rules (and a very ugly jungle gym), they get angry. They launder money as "Speech" and make our law say what it must. They default to their own Privacy in all situations, while they benefit from passive surveillance on us to exist as we do. Companies make economies, but please have some limits.

Were corporations our actual governments, some of the giantism tribes would seem mighty ripe for power struggles. Were our Chiefs not so implicitly immune to our feedback (the explicitly voiced troubles of People), we would have hope! But alas, companies are formed specifically to map this authoritarian method to somewhere it is suited, in free enterprise.

The need for Public infrastructure wasn't hard to notice early, but now we have a Unitary Executive risen from a shape-shifting corporate "Person" who wants to buy companies away from the stock market, turning the market into a slave pickup location. The Chiefest Person is looking for anyone desperately devout in their worship of Mammon, to work for his whims. You'll be told you'll be treated well, since your acquiescence (the predictable part) was step one in their aim.

There is a veritable body of Rules lying about us like so many forgotten sharp weapons. Do you have apostate lawyers searching for these like MAGA does? I prefer to treat their study of Lawfare relics as an obsession with mysticism: They will not require finesse with it when they set to work in earnest.

Today, the Unitary Executive, Chief of all, is not taking feedback, except through Susie Wiles and whichever friends are over. It's why Lefts boo at openly at any White Nationalist dinner guests. MAGA says this is just talk and that The Mind Virus spreads blame like butter without knowing anything—credibility can't be on Their side. You Were Not In The Room (By Design). Susie Wiles and others are (and sometimes not with Wiles).
- [://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles)

The Office's occupant was installed to not need any feedback.

We hesitate to control companies the way we're too afraid to go into Uvalde. Do we all secretly know what they're armed with and how bad it could go?

Is it up to God who survives a fight? Welcome to America, where In God We Trust since 1956 and for some centuries before.

It's all about God, it is in fact all about your Feelings. The Homeland must ultimately be His, Mormons in Missouri or not.

#### Tucker Carlson

It is first and foremost a shame that Tucker Carlson was the one capable of even pestering Netanyahu for an interview, to counter an Iranian interview, after a Putin interview, after leaving the basically-exonerated and rising Fox News family. Somehow nobody thinks he should be running back to Fox, because he's got something else and everyone sees the dynamic range.

As humans, it doesn't matter how weird or storied we are. History doesn't care where you came from, only what you made happen.

**Are you the kind of person who makes things happen _at all_?** The happening of things is what creates churn, change, and opportunity fresh and flowing. It's not even a Capitalism thing. We endeavor to texture our experience, by discovery or fabrication. Power throughout history is touched by those who made themselves be where it would be, and they put themselves to its work like a field. Value is not what you can resell on Etsy in your sleep, it is knowing that you personally have the wherewithal to try your hand on something you know has value.

Real work creates new value in a stale market, making possible entirely new comparisons for where more value may lie. The entire market gets fresh speculation, not caring if Tucker is right on the particulars. The worship of procedure is on display. It is an infinite art, alive as long as we are.

Tucker Carlson went international and though he started out broadcasting unmitigated Russian propaganda about how Americans should think of Russia, the Iranian interview was proof he had no plan to say anything specific, but was starting something. Netanyahu had already declined requests multiple times.

Some like DeSantis went international but didn't go as far without well-networked conventions near and far to inflate his aura. Some like Rubio now look a little crisped by Trump's energy but adapt quickly to requesting citizen detainment on foreign soils. There are others, like Lindsey Graham who dance when called on. Of the "journalists" especially, how is it that only Carlson is making original content that isn't just another rebroadcasting channel (This week's emergency episode sponsored by whatever.)

I want interviews with the Japanese, the French. I want to see our politicians fail to do more than filler and realize they're not varsity yet. And I want it like a coach wants to see improvement. I do want to see our People succeed on international issues, but I know they're going to flail for a while.

Geopolitically isolated in so many ways, our home is not diversified enough in its thoughts. The worst part of a Biden term was that we prepared nothing for a new answer, and nor did our journalists. They are all reacting, merging with the Authoritarian's aura, the natural shriek made by a forest when real danger is in fact coming. The shriek is the most satisfying sound you could make, because it communicates all the power in one single instant transmission: You believe you're already powerless.

I worry in earnest what Americans should do if foreign powers try to land here to intervene. America is its own Alcatraz, for those the Unitary Executive says are prisoner now. Imprisoned in America, there is no help coming, and we're suddenly funding ICE better than any prison system.

Never was it clearer when Biden's envoys abroad did nothing, and Trump's people did everything, that traditional backgrounds were still flimsy compared to grit. Blinken was wringing his hands and promising dinner soon while he knew it was on fire back there, and Carlson was talking with Iran on the web. Broadcasting Iran was not especially important a thing to do, but there was no way Carlson was going to do propaganda for them as such. He churned things, sue him.

There are numerous ways for Carlson to stay irrelevant to me, but there are moments he seems peerless. It feels more like a statement of such sparse contenders, how little it takes versus the entire corporatized body of trained "journalists".

#### Mind Virus

The Mind Virus is a church of humankind also founded in America like Protestants. Construed however, it has no universal priests. This is often missed on critics who want to challenge one champion by proxy.

Like a church, the Mind Virus expects its fellows to be ready to hear anything. This works well in many places where a different kind of rugged individualism shapes Millennials and others who lost their fear of Strangers along with the lights coming on all across our social media graphs and showing us that few were actually that scary. It was no longer viable for The News to broadcast into America's homes that their neighbors were putting drugs and razor blades in Trick Or Treat bags. We weren't that scary if we just talked.

But just talking didn't do the whole job. Pushing out the range of social borders, the Mind Virus found not everyone believed the same way in the shared doctrine. Indeed, even many religious have no qualms with the microscopic principles of Wokeness. Wokeness in a certain era could be mocked for attacking itself, but mockery is self-soothing behavior and to attack Wokeness you had to attack a wider way of being. Now the Wokeness was hiding in companies who had suspiciously not bent the knee to the Chief and its amassing culture.

There must needs be a reason why more knees were not bent to the Chief. It was that pesky Mind Virus holding back even The Good Ones. Not believing that They should be allowed to have the Virus in secret either, Authority was necessary to expunge it and to prescribe what should be done instead. The prescription would not go down so easily were it not for the American flag wrapping the Provider, and the label you should look no further than: Patriotism, a label only the government doctor in particular could claim. You don't get to pick this side, and they openly discuss what they want for their own Domestic Enemies.

All the while, the Faithful already believe in the coming weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, foretold by scripture.

The Mind Virus is a predictable large-network response to needing ponds of safety in a hostile-default environment that buzzes warnings when you have its attention for any reason. Soon, the preachers of groups found their individual voices weren't good enough, and simplified language was negotiated on social media with much infighting. You're Bad If You Don't Heart This.

Authoritarianism is a predictable large-network response to needing finer individual control. It deploys efficient systems to do this, applying its genius sustainably. Tony Stark came out of that cave resurrected three days later because He Knows More Than You. It's not just doing more with less. With a stronger mastery of base principles, more can be wrought than by pedestrians. Authoritarian rationalizations include long lists of explicit reasons and needs. The ideology is arriving because it was made possible by that list, and it already knows that you mock things on the list. They already know. That's why it's on the list.

This large patch of exposed ground on planet Earth "needs" neither philosophy. These are brought by People with motives, as are all things.

Companies are the perfect tinctures of authoritarianism, but then they said a CEO "should" be President, who "should" run the Country like a Business. They meant it in every way possible. Beholden to no one, equipped with fine powers over its self-guided dominion (Greenland and Canada too?), immune with anything it calls "official business", the terms can still update nightly when necessary.

When we reduce our great Constitution (and the amendments they remembered to add) and system of law into the one amorphous Rule, two rules appear and you can select which to use:
- Play where it's clear, and
- Climb on it.

There are deeper doctrines than those (Carve it.) which spring from mastery of these. The Mind Virus and its claimed antidotes are purity tests that identify Which Type You Are, whatever that is, and quickly. The Mind Virus's purported function is the fence of safety in spaces. Once in a culture where we had Privacy and could hide from the digital, we now have to clear physical spaces to find unbothered refuge. Conservatives knew all along about safe space, they just don't like it staked on public ground. And because it's so public, they can tell sometimes that coddling is worse than correction and they see too much coddling.

For the Authoritarian perpetrators wielding Religion in their off-hand, public ground can contain Bibles, Commandments and Icons. They proudly report their desire to capture truly more public space. They Are Owed This Now, they say. They wouldn't have done this had you simply not existed in public first, of course. Talk about Terms you heard about too late...

Their powers of prediction are so holy, that them not doing this sooner might be the real problem they see. Now they have so much work to show they were right all along.

Their All-Along America First vision is astonishingly inept in ways, but like Tucker Carlson, the churn makes opportunity for all. Forget the particulars. Look at what is creaking as a result of what they do, and make that stronger so that it withstands. Make it better.

There are no Authority figures coming to help. It is up to you, and when you weather and feel stronger, you'll understand Pride as MAGA does. They are a step ahead in their Authority, having acquired their powerful piece. They have defensively set in for decades in anticipation of these times.

Anti-Woke is backfilling its reservoirs of cultural grievances, and they haven't reached their Woke-like supersaturation. It will get louder.

### What is wrong?

#### Crime

I have suffered enough deep conservative talk in these decades that spin White Collar Crimes as hoaxes with the same derision they later used on Institutional Racism. Complaining means you got played, so it is always allowed in America to follow up by laughing at them for it.

`"What are you gonna do, call the cops?"`

Their exploitation goes deep. Knowing no bounds with the data of People, agents of these Businesses interact with our political representatives in nimbler ways than us.

The methods which Businesses use, most of all the giantism corporations, should amount to digital theft. Put entirely aside the talk of AI needing stolen materials to train—these companies are `Training on Your Data`.

Where is Your Copyright? Aren't you the singular source of all this data? Is the predatory language of contracts all that was provided?

How about if they keep doing it, they pay Peoples' fines, which are sharper than what the Executives have allowed with federal government?

We must deflate the goblins and clowns that run political meta-games, but we also must assert that `there is crime against People`, and we intend to define it. If we must use the language of copyright, let us discuss the mechanics of this magic consent they extract without our knowing.

`The theft of your consent is Fraud.`

Any sign of Regulation on an Authority-driven business incenses, that anyone at all could find their own Authority to counter the God-given one to have an Authoritarian enterprise.

Our leaders sometimes pay some lip service for Two-Tiered Justice. The Unitary Executive even claims that is the term for the battle it alone faces, before proliferating the Meme Of It to X and Truth Social, for the acquisition of real-time polling data.

We attack the "quality" of data that AI uses to train, but I assure you, arguments about that and synthetic data are nonsense next to the human race itself generating Our Data. It is first-party and it comes with metadata and if the data "belongs" to Businesses then they are free to make claims with it.

As surely as the People know that AI agents do not fluently represent these Businesses, We know that these Businesses are not fluent in representing us. They think they own our data, the way a farmer owns the milk.

Human beings are a generational, renewable resource. We are on the menu. Change at any point in the future is welcome and possible, but sooner is better.

Make criminals of those who make markets of stalking us. Their informational collusion is improper. In Europe we saw a Right To Be Forgotten—well named in fact. Companies remember us permanently, and it goes on your records. Surveillance will be necessary for the function of some things and so it must be well Designed, but this is grotesque and uncontrolled, not designed at all. They made turf of our data and they are farming in it now.

Give humanity recognition of its data rights. Make their abuse for profit a crime. Make it impossible for the Authoritarian to smear someone with semi-public data by not leaving it around so much. Demote their claims with metadata to purest hearsay.

#### Housing

Housing never made it to a human right status, and at this point if we tried, we'd define People as the "right" People and discard the ones who were our evidence. Utah's housing-first programs are offensive to some MAGA because that whole "way out" contravenes the important dogma about how badly we need to banish The Unexceptional. Peasant wisdom supplants academia, and the peasants aren't sending their best: Ain't no way givin away houses works. ("Do you know how much those cost?!")

To our cries of `Follow The Money` at one another out of earshot, corporations bought the places of dwelling and also invested in a rent-controlling software run by no one who takes credit. That renter agency whatever firm that bought you up like everywhere? They're here to make a quick buck with the local resources: Humans.

In Loveland, the staff openly sell us out to companies for flyers up on our door-side communication boards. The mailbox wasn't enough dignity. This was VIP positioning. The company was for somewhere in Fort Collins.

Why is my property manager hawking me? Like, why is this even happening? Is my software-fattened rent literally not enough to support the basic business model? Am I not getting something by the principle of exchange, `or Are You Not Done Yet?`

For injury, some People and corporate "people" possess "homes" like trading cards.

The rate of rent increase across this country is unfathomable, and I know it with my own metadata. There are no entry points to better living.

Release the houses. Tax the holy hell out of excessive ownership. We demand better, on it all. In Phoenix I had a woman tear my deposit check in half right in front of me by error, and when I told them months later about it the manager gaslit me about this happening being another location. They have no respect for the cattle. They have no need. They stress about how to bleed us, and we stress about how to pay them.

Any lawyer will tell you to `"Just Move Somewhere Else"` if you don't like your landlord. I will re-indicate that they own all of these properties. Capital creates too much power when it spills through state boundaries. We see this in Citizens United magic, and all kinds of Speech laundering.

PR and parasocial ownership of things have together spoiled the customer service of housing. This rises to our abuse, the same in every way to enterprises which crave our renewable data.

Americans want to see the prices again, not this constant magic by software, more cogs that create distance between responsible engines of our harm.

We cannot build enough homes for the magnitude of this ownership crisis, but we don't have to. They already exist, they are just the new gold.

Their disengorgement will not go by smoothly. Their best move is to sell to us. Now. Corporate personhood cannot also grant them pretend homes.

Get out, fake "people".

#### Enforcement of Law

The meta-game of Law enforcement will be played with data-brokered evidence. National domestic companies, or say the foreign ones like Placer Labs, peddle everything and indulge in their own perfect Privacy while we have none.

We require public projects that have consent-based data, and we need cities willing to care about using it. No middleman taxing our data for the honor of planting their brand flag in our faces.

Cut off the data. Foreign software enterprises should also not be capable of siloing or monetizing that data. Cut it off. Software engineers will hate being regulated for once in their lives but make them provide compliant databases for information categories. That's not just regulation, that's a call to create some markets, by God. Start treating our data as recognizably ours, and personal enough that it not should be copied and sold like a weird fetish. If our DNA evidence were collected so promptly we may well succeed in getting a restraining order on them. Make it so for our personally identifiable sensitive data.

Such a re-reading of Privacy will be painful beyond measure, but it must be so. Make this one of our great projects.

When I watched Star Trek as a kid, and compared with other science-fictional dramas, I saw in a lot of cases that a plot got its drama from an unrealistic lack or failure of the plausible security devices of that future. As writers of these things, or enjoyers, we say it's in service of the story. Not everything has to be so realistic when the rule is fun.

Realistic is this: We are crawling with security countermeasure systems, but they are vulnerable. The nature of security is that it cannot be solved, so measuring success is not about how talented our people are. If there is one area we are doing better at than ever, it's cybersecurity.

Yet it cannot be solved. With AI adding code to the tinder pile built by Vibes, security issues will enter a post-scarcity era. It'll be amateur hour out there. Security is not always about losing control of your account; Sometimes you lose control of the knowledge of what you're facilitating. A most mundane example: If you run a site, and someone managed to sneak their own page on that site and there were no links to it, how long would it take you to notice? Do you look at your traffic reports and memorize all your slugs? What if they only use it _sometimes_? What if they picked you because your bad site can be leveraged as a weapon to deliver the right payloads?

You and I and every lightbulb you bought and plugged in (each of which you assume is still auto-updating firmware, set and forget) are a pool of targets.

"What can they do with a lightbulb?" you might ask. They could tell on you when you're home, or just use you in a junk attack on someone else. The internet protocols and the robo-burps and blips which ferry your data around in pieces are themselves vulnerable in their individual instances. Your lightbulb makes tiny replies, but the force multiplier is visible at just 10,000 Capitalistically-available bulbs talking in unison each and every time a pied piper asks. The results of these infrequent struggles is a magnification traffic jam beam weapon, fire-ready from everywhere in the world to anywhere else. The fully automatic targeting systems with infinite barrel fire come for free. The downside is that the weapon can only shoot at itself.

There are entire systems that run the internet as a whole which depend on bizarrely peaceful behavior. Should IP-space routing come under deliberate attack, Foreign Enemies can isolate crude shapes in the web, or stop some data flow without giving up their own because of the shape of the actual planet.

Cyber warfare takes place on a field you can't see, for reasons you can't know in advance. Like diseases, the tactics must surmount all previous evolution and still leap oceans. The tactics are cunning and plentiful and assisted by several selected conditions. Personal data is your targeting coordinates, whether or not a state actor is handling it. Cyber attacks are well funded, but at the scale of Business, `They Are All Participating` anyway.

Let's see some 90s-flavored Stranger Danger about who out there has your address and what they do with that. You could make multiple seasons of Mythbusters-focused content bent on showing what in fact they do. You could even watch the reruns just because they're on. They'd be Public Service Announcements worth repeating.

When I speak to AT&T's human in-store agents about them not even knowing the programs or partners who get their real-time locations and ethnicities, there is a shared propensity to offer up unscripted that everyone is jumping off of that bridge, and it's normal these days. Just shy of "So don't work with us if we're so bad~", concern is met with an actual `"That's on you."` No, not even if we "won" Personalized Plus would it fix any of this. It's a wake-up moment to notice.

Encryption has fundamentally invalidated the traditional wire-tapping paradigm (though our phone networks are very vulnerable). The opportunity to tap "after the fact" is sometimes still there, but with increasing math puzzles in the way of each piece. The result is that the opportunity cost to solve those is massively (orders of magnitude) not worth it, like putting a ream of cross-shredded paper back together, but only the important parts.

Short of infiltrating encryption itself, the best some government gets is attacking access for impersonating you. Much easier, especially if your face to unlock can be compelled by the Law.

The world moves into "end-to-end" encrypted messaging, but the metadata is leaking everywhere. Facebook's made-up parent Meta owns Whatsapp, which uses your real phone numbers. Why do you think they want that? It's valuable to their "graph" of you for exactly the same reasons AT&T and other carriers want to enrich your ad profile data on you. You are the thing of value.

Some messaging apps do encryptions well, reducing real risks about who can get into your device(s) (which're all cloud-synched now, right? Remember my password ✅). Impersonation is the _only_ vector then.

So encryption is winning?

Companies, from Meta to Apple, possess the required power of "key management". You get to have a property manager, which you never see but makes sure you and your roomies have keys when you need and even for guests—no problems. Each key even has everyone's own ID carved on it and their photo. Nobody's losing their keys, but somehow homes are getting entered into. With the security theater all still present, can the property manager just make a new key, even one single key, for an unknown? And not even disclose? What are the steps to verify they should have one? How easy is it for the government to acquire one without explanation? Can I Even Revoke It?

They can simply do wiretapping again, sponsored by corporate compliance-assistance. If AI is ever put on this job of listening, this can be industrialized virtually overnight. We might need Law about what tier of AI can be used for listening activated only by subject matter. (It would be a fascinating paper to read, please do science on this.)

Repeatedly, the words of Congress are absent when the Unitary Executive proclaims another re-reading of Law. It can enact that on us, but is it perhaps a problem that `No Law Is Protecting Us`? The Executive need not walk through walls here: It moved before we built any, because it watched us not do so and then subsequently Capitalized knowing that we would give away all the time it asked for and still not do the only things necessary to our defense.

I am willing to select companies to trust, but how can I or anyone, with No Law?

Companies retain key management responsibilities because it makes our products seamless: That cloud sync you're using when you set up a new device is working because it joined your account by magic. These days, you may only have pointed your iPhone's camera at a colorful dotted ball animation and somehow that was enough. The iOS devices are doing a graceful job of hiding truly secure steps, but those are the hoops you have to jump through.

Meta retains key management but does content scanning. Meta alone accounts for the vast majority of reported CSAM, but that's a gold medal: No one else is trying to detect much but rookie numbers. Meta is legitimately advancing the state of the art, like Tucker Carlson!

Metadata about known illegal images can be compacted and made into a fast checker database. It's a lot, but by running it in the mythical Cloud, where their apps and website live anyway, they can worry about how to get it done on all your messages as efficiently as possible. They don't technically have to look right at it if the proverbial x-ray scanner beeps about its metadata. Unique metadata was noise and was unremarkable and not inspected.

Microsoft and others have participated in experimental CSAM detection in videos, but nothing has yet come to make them post a victory blog about it.

After at-home Photoshops, AI goes on to supply sufficiently offensive images much faster than was previously even reasonable. Chasing all these down is not even viable anymore. The database isn't gonna scale if it chases generative AI images. Do humans also need to do the work of validating AI-made images, or can we make the AIs help do that part please?

We need defenses that scale properly against AI. To me that means locally accountable AI, where it exists at all. Our vendors need vast and new accountability clauses when they `Start Acting In Our Interests`.

Cities and companies can work out friendly terms for contracts, but it is all fundamentally insufficient if they are paying fees instead of fingers for mistreating our data.

Before long, AI will be embodied in your homes. More than lightbulbs and dishwashers will have your consent to operate there, and these companies will either wise up and create real data fences on Private things, or they will absolutely not. These companies don't negotiate with anything but a commercial, no Public scrutiny as long as they got the elusive Consent.

The scope of what companies have is massive, and that doesn't have to be bad. Can we please have `some Protection, Government?`

Government and Law enforcement are increasingly confused by their duties and instead use us. They are meta-gaming too frequently with one another. Our federal government did not need an autonomous ambition to come into its creation, and it is not expedient to have one now.

Blind except to metadata, and being great at meaningful interventions, is a viable method of surveillance, but the threat of untagged generative AI content means we don't know which metadata anymore. If we elect for the ability to enact blocks on untagged media on our popular platforms, or the powers to block media with specific tags, `a censorship government can be enacted overnight`. The World Wide Web contracted, and it is social media apps now.

Companies budgeting for the compliance fees should be the punchline of a tired joke, but `if fees had any teeth`, they would take their duty seriously. If we're sleepwalking into surveillance, at least do that job. It really is too much to trust The Government to do even the job it has. Data Brokers need to be shown we're serious, that they will lose fingers if they cross us in this way. Muster the will for this change.

Going into this AI-charged era, having not mastered any of the technologies we possessed, more rough-shod surveillance will be the stopgap. Politics steers companies too easily just now. In a way, it will be nice to know so much alibi information was and is on hand for the innocent who indeed had nothing to fear. In another very pressing way, the Unitary Executive likes arranging data into smear constellations which are easy to solve over social media. This everlasting tantrum is its method.

This Executive was chosen for its ability to inventory all, the purest Authoritarian available, with mileage now but aging for his admirers like wine.

Mass metadata surveillance will be bolstered by tagging AI media. CSAM detection is a proper good work. The media we share is being serial-numbered and followed like research birds, regardless of what it is.

We are being surveilled so thoroughly that for all the Thin Blue Line holds the peace, it also barely retains the Unitary Executive from the other side.

Law enforcement will become less and less about the police employed by your town. If you're wondering who it will be about instead, the Unitary Executive will explain it in so many words.

If AI is coming, bring it local, so that we can run it in full view of our publics like accountable servants. It should not be generally possible that the Police could stalk anyone without judicial assistance, but I will personally settle (for now) for something like the Law, federal or local, needing to ask my city when they need data releases.

#### Representation in a Capitalist society

The mass and real-time summary of resident opinions is nigh. There is no City Council in America that can support the ratio of Authority it is already responsible for.

In normal times, only the "interested" had to go and probably participate if they wanted. Political wind shifts toward real-time changes, top-down Authority and its coordinating orders. A City Council is simply not proportioned enough.

If they want governments run like businesses, why not show everyone what that ought to mean, what difference our decency in democracy makes.

Reject Authoritarian songs. You have learned placation from the companies, and this is identical to that. Your Rationalizations will speak loudly that it has been working "fine" up to now. But has it? Is it not the thesis of color partisans that All Is Not Fine?

We barely know the meaning of a snap election. We still close polling locations strategically, still cancel voter rolls opportunistically, still obstruct basic registration itself, and having a proof of citizenship required will not make any of the rest stop.

Our representation is being actively diminished by the Unitary Executive, and we have the technologies to do the inverse.

Assist your city and its districts by doing better than flooding them: Build them better ways to query your community. Approach its Design to work for everybody. Focus AI on work we find altogether infeasible, and let us possess that AI engine so that it may be audited by those who care for its function and operation. At least a town droid would be pitching in.

Construct real-time opinion polling on hardware that we own. It doesn't turn every meeting into an American Idol voting show, but even bucketing the same questions together and counting them is considered revolutionary at this stage. You barely have to try, as long as you can do it. Go full Tucker Carlson on it, and take some public debate on the chin.

And be ready to take some responsibility and care for Our data. Your data.

Local is our own answer. Let them aggregate us, but not without our hand at the bottom of the Go-Team huddle.

The Unitary Executive flirts with state ownership of companies and desires more.

Divest this, burn two bad ideas at once and fix Universal Basic Income with a stronger plan: Give the People a cut of their stock market. Part ownership. The dividend we seek is the one that reflects their tethered interest in us.

We are all not all their shareholders, but they are shareholders in our data. It is not right. Citizens should be empowered by a UBI that reflects our economies.

Allow us to send away some money from this fund for tax-beneficial endeavors that replace Congressional funding. Let them call to us for money on ideas, and let those ideas compete and let us have consent for applying our money to them. Congress is not a suitable location to hash out individual consent, so unscope the issue by putting the business of our consent in our hands, while politicians worry about the quality of their the choices they put on offer.

#### Regulation

Politicians are forced to play the wrong meta-games for their legacy survival. In machine code talk, they use an outdated instruction set that can't represent modern ideas without multiple cycles to emulate it.

Politicians have become bad foundries of ideas, and regulating their failure for the People's interest is our chief responsibility in a Democracy obsessing with its Authority.

Leaders in our government claim wisdoms as amazing as The loudest voices have bad reasons. Guilty until proven innocent, this Authoritarian tincture deploys its corporate law with it: Complainers must be `Anti-s`.

Big Man Says politics cannot outlast the persona. Just like Our Bad Schools, just like our bad leadership for Lefts, this government is not teaching good governance to those it hires and fires like they're auditioning for an Apprentice. For Trump believers this is the process in action that he preached. This is ministry in action. Having secured a Rationalization, they certainly won't look for any additional Reason.

The most elevated voices in America are those like Peter Thiel, who is shockingly connected to many technologies you know the names of, and he's a White Paper Manifesto type, enjoying pitches about autonomous charisma states run by the rich on foreign lands. They want our Land next, and the religions might even lose that scuffle. To not make us mad, they will use African land, or Greenland's land. They will use the tactics of Business and secret Privilege on our domestic partners as surely as they have conquered us. It could not be without this Authoritarian at our head, who is so friendly to business that he hears it in its purest language: He agrees.

It has been unthinkable in general that the United States would have an imperialist spasm and go capture Canada, or Greenland. The idea is too big, like unbuilding a sky scraper to put something else there. The answers our leaders give are as devious as their business methods. Governments can deploy more than one currency to make favor. By poaching with loyalty in other nations, they can infect the course of Law in countries that are supposedly our allies. We can say from our Experiment that they can and will do it, with internationally favored fiat currency they also derived from us.

They will make us pay for their walls. If you like the idea of living in a tech billionaire's charisma state in a DMZ in Greenland as the glaciers melt and a northern shipping lane boom era occurs and Russia and the United States really do work together again without war, we might have something in common some days.

But we have seen their methods, their means. They subvert. They Do Not Understand Consent.

Consent is a frequently read chapter of the Mind Virus's specification. Not comprehending consent has been a useful quick measure of Which Kind You Are when we don't have time to digest the PR history of every designer persona to "get them" or something. We have deep and undeserved patience for PR speak in this Country, and the illusion could shatter as quickly as the danger of powered GameBoys, iPods and laptops at takeoff.

They paid people to halt their own planes over batteries being on, and claimed without checking that it had to do with the radios. These people understand regulation and even invent it for themselves.

Everyone's a regulator. You are one of your community's regulators, and if you don't believe it, listen to MAGA tell their people. Regulation is not the Meme You Hold Up about it. Regulation is an idea that applies to you and these companies. Dictate locally (because the Constitution does not) what these companies are allowed to do.

We have surrendered our ability to dictate anything, to Congresses that stopped being bipartisan before Trump appeared.

We want change, because we want something back: Our representatives need to have voices in their Congress too. The Unitary Executive already has a Branch, it does not have any prerogative with our representational one. Executives have been free to use personality and cajoling, but not loyalty on an expedient schedule. The haste could not be, were this a well-reasoned public plan instead of a Privileged one. There would be no Enemies for the Unitary Executive to declare.

Our representatives need stricter regulation, not just in using the stock market artifact-invention of Capitalism. Now, we need representatives that will help defend companies in their state from federal takeover. The threat is possible now, and the Unitary Executive gloated that the CEO of Intel came fearful for its job and then was saved by Grace, of the Chief Executive Officer.

The Unitary Executive is doing miracles on its sick, and this unholy revivification will work to raise a financially enslaved brand militia. They will make domestic TRUMP-branded products, they will be forced to supply Expedient Things to loyal partners and then be held out to dry. The era of shell companies will be over. You are his shells now, and he can even make them fight each other when he pulls his financial strings and wants to put on a show. This Executive knows entertainment only. The administration's talking faces claim the shares in Intel are "non-voting" but you would be a fool in social science to think that's an honest appraisal. Honest appraisals are not what this Executive ever did well.

Representatives must swear more powerful oaths. They must take oaths about our data. Companies must sign our Terms. Self-Regulation is necessary, and it must begin with reprogramming the rules that are Not Fine and which have enabled Authority to run too far by half.

We cannot have one wit of good conversation about "Regulation" the Meme until we have a tangible proof that this ground can shift dramatically more than we're complacent to think.

Till this earth, and make markets with Regulation. Conservatives have loathed Regulation that is just inflation, so show them you're more than your own pejoratively-given label. Start calling goods ideas Regulation without being ashamed. Teach them what Regulation means again. Take their slur from them and show them they judged and their Memes were wrong.

We'll talk about politicians losing their incomes in another piece. They are paid like celebrity fortune tellers and it has nothing to do with this necessary part:

Regulate. Even machines regulate. It is not a bad word.
