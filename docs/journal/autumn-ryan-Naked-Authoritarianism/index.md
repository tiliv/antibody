      “Are there other groups that you can think of?” a reporter asked.
    - |
      "We have some pretty `radical groups`, and they `got away with murder`."

      "`They come in a beautiful new car.` They’re so proud and `it’s Border
      Patrol, ICE, you know`, it’s got whatever it is, and they’re throwing
      rocks at it. And after 50 yards, it looks like an old, beat up
      vehicle. It was just brand new. `It was just bought for the purposes`,
      and they don’t have to take that anymore."

      “`I say when they spit, you hit.` Do whatever you want. `You do
      whatever the hell you want`,” Trump told reporters.
