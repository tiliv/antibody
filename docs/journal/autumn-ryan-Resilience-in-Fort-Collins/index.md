The Coloradoan did great work assembling a profile of each candidate, and universally, the candidates appreciate your attention to their websites.

I will not be ranking these candidates for you, but you get to!

Before an election, these were People already busy using their skills to think about the community. After an election, these people won't cease to exist! You can work with them and generate support for what they do.

### A reason to stay

- the retreat of local journalism
- the confusion of partisan leaderships with split attention
- the paralysis of political action groups, as shared national issues take the oxygen
- a non-partisan, ranked choice election in Fort Collins
- what people are doing for themselves
- 1 Million Cups
- economic development
- discovery in the age of user-hostile markets
- sustainability
- elections, ranked choice, non-partisan
- mayoral forum by the League of Women Voters
- a missing candidate

### What Do You Need?

On November 20 2024, I scrawled my notes on a weekday night for the only public project concept that wouldn't leave my mind. Its name was only "What Do You Need?" because it seemed so few actually heard such needs.

I see people with bills they can't pay before there is any eviction notice, so orgs can't help. I see people with eating disorders unable to get the care they need because their BMI is a fraction of a point too low. I see beloved businesses close because it's just too expensive. I hear people struggle to get transportation when they need it without extravagant prior arrangements.

Our entrepreneurs meet on a Wednesday at 9am, while others can't. There are more events going on in the community for business owners and by non-profits than anyone knows. (Just ask the candidates! They have the same need.)

There are help organizations which push paperwork in someone's hands, replete with every niche question they might ever want to know about their concept, only for the first meeting to be with someone who hasn't read that unholy stack of paper. Maybe the meeting is a rejection, and everyone's time was wasted.

To seek help is costly on time, and to be lost in a game of qualification is insulting to them. They resent this declaration that they are not right for help. It is monstrously alienating and strengthens any underground culture that critiques the worth of these systems. The systems and agents do not ask for meaningful feedback, and certainly can't implement unsolicited feedback.

I needed leaders who knew the heartbeat of their city and where it needed some of that listening I heard about at the forum. I needed voices that could foil for the front-runners and make them accountable to their stances.

In Fort Collins, a ranked choice election gives you the power to say more with your vote, to pack more metadata. Your vote is more sophisticated now.

Technically, you don't have to do more than rank a first and finish, but at long last, that failure can be on us and the candidates, not the medium itself.

Fort Collins candidates aren't taking party money, so more than ever they need to mean what they say and earn your high rank.

Vote fearlessly for your honest firsts. You could rank several underdogs above your safe pick and face no loss of control.

Let your intent be seen, even if you can't win it all. They can measure it now.

Help your candidates know you see them through general noise of all else. They really do need you.

#### Centering

In conversation, they all know there is an observable effect on the centering.

Not a mere average of Real Positions, this centering is helping these party-less individuals identify priorities that have voters they can count.

These candidates remember their party affiliations, but I pay for the media I consume and haven't seen an ad in years. It doesn't make me centered, but I certainly got to calibrate with them directly.

They have to conjure their own money, and so the game does become a bit about who can summon donations with their bespoke grit and prior credentials. Despite this, the content of their speech is on display.

I know well that Shirley Peel observes what I do, that whether or not memes, videos, ads or news stand by what passes for their sources, the grand act of washing data through many sources makes it too easy for outlets to say by the weight of context that they need not even cite their hearsay anymore, because it is consensus.

You reader, and you candidate, will be benefitted from real experience with this phenomenon of laundered facts: It is hearsay that has lost its citations when you encounter it in the wild, having gotten away with it by trust, apathy or nepotism.

To my wondering with Shirley whether there was candidate willpower for the same overall format into future elections, Shirley could imagine opportunity to refine it for the free speech core at any politician's platform. City Council is full of the women she knows and works with personally and professionally, but they don't represent her better than she represents herself. She's looking for ways to gather local voices.

If you instead want "centered" the way r/moderatepolitics is centering tone to discuss big things, Adam Hirschhorn can serve you. He may not want to meet just anybody, but he might plausibly explain why that lets him protect you from rogue Authority.

Despite a functioning society, it is a sign of times that some of us sense the earnest truth of Adam Hirschhorn's promise on that point, and could rank him well for some times. It's hard to know when to break the glass for The Emergency, but I know a few who would be happier to put any ranked vote on Hirschhorn than they usually are in a closed party system with rogue independents.

What I think will be truly centering in Fort Collins is the data from the ranked results. Not just a binding upon them, I hope the format affords our city's candidates fresh new access to their public, a more centered reflection of support that they can look forward to cultivating.

#### Civility

There is little to address on the point of division and civility. ScottyV presses on the format to highlight its lost authenticity. Our candidates want discussions, whether or not they are using the 90 seconds to say it or another thing.

Social medias have showed us how hard it is to say anything at all in a whole enough form not to draw argument. With civility, we say call off the argument and focus on your positive motion. Seated with the mics though, like for surveys, they only get to answer the questions as brought to them at last.

The forum was a good tour, but clipped in its way. What I like about real life is that People can't yet use ChatGPT to speak for them.

Very sensibly, they all invite direct discussion, but it is a measure of something real when I get to see what animates them with time limits involved.

There is a lot of discussion of listening to solve problems.

In my time attending political action groups in the state of Colorado, I find them engorged on national discussions. They want to help locally, but we're the ones sitting down thinking of how to do that, and we have no idea. We should barely be responsible, but it feels like you're burning oil because you're the only ones tonight.

Those of us working on issue selection were doing our best but I watched basically nobody else mark "truth in media" as an issue that affected them personally, and I call that a lie. That Is A Lie. Our media is syndicated and damaged and branded when it arrives to us, even (especially) on social media.

I fear there isn't enough for our leaders to hear in elections. The people can't say it unless they can skillfully conjure tricks in social media, where content is encouraged to be shorter and shorter.

I promote civility, though like ScottyV I must wonder loudly sometimes at what we are expected to say with our brutally short time slots.

Do A Trick, observers will demand, and I don't blame ScottyV or hypothetical others for saying No to the premise and selecting their own.

What does it look like to resort to other civil means?

What can we say yet, except to notice that our time has by and large been taken from us People?

May We Have Our Time Back?
