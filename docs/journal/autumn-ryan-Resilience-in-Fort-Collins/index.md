### A reason to stay

- the retreat of local journalism
- the confusion of partisan leaderships with split attention
- the paralysis of political action groups, as shared national issues take the oxygen
- a non-partisan, ranked choice election in Fort Collins
- what people are doing for themselves
- 1 Million Cups
- economic development
- discovery in the age of user-hostile markets
- sustainability

- elections, ranked choice, non-partisan
- mayoral forum by the League of Women Voters
- a missing candidate

I will not be ranking these candidates for you, but you must.

#### What Do You Need?

On November 20 2024, I scrawled my notes on a weekday night for the only public project concept that wouldn't leave my mind. Its name was only "What Do You Need?" because it seemed so few actually heard such needs.

I see people with bills they can't pay before there is any eviction notice, so orgs can't help. I see people with eating disorders unable to get the care they need because their BMI is a fraction of a point too low. I see beloved businesses close because it's just too expensive. I hear people struggle to get transportation when they need it without extravagant prior arrangements.

Our entrepreneurs meet on a Wednesday at 9am, while others can't. There are more events going on in the community for business owners and by non-profits than anyone knows. (Just ask the candidates! They have the same need.)

There are help organizations shove paperwork in someone's hands, replete with every niche question they might ever want to know about their concept, only for the first meeting to be with someone who hasn't read that unholy stack of paper. Maybe the meeting is a rejection, and everyone's time was wasted.

To seek help is costly on time, and to be lost in a game of qualification is insulting to them. They resent this declaration that they are not right for help. It is monstrously alienating and strengthens any underground culture that critiques the worth of these systems. The systems and agents do not ask for meaningful feedback, and certainly can't implement unsolicited feedback.

I needed leaders who knew the heartbeat of their city and where it needed some of that listening I heard about at the forum. I needed voices that could foil for the front-runners and make them accountable to their stances.

In Fort Collins, a ranked choice election gives you the power to say more with your vote, to pack more metadata. Your vote is more sophisticated now.

Technically, you don't have to do more than rank a first and finish, but at long last, that failure can be on us and the candidates, not the medium itself.

Fort Collins candidates aren't taking party money, so more than ever they need to mean what they say and earn your high rank.

Vote fearlessly for your honest firsts. You could rank several underdogs above your safe pick and face no loss of control.

Let your intent be seen, even if you can't win it all. They can measure it now.

Help your candidates know you see them through general noise of all else. They really do need you.
