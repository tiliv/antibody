### Notes

- I began my inquiries when I saw traffic cameras taking epilepsy-tier sustained shots of intersections for nearly 10 seconds, wherein no traffic violations are taking place.
- I witnessed this at a second intersection, for the third time in 2 weeks, and only during a rush hour.
- There are no traffic studies going on.
- Verra Mobility supplies local police departments with photos they surmise are violating local law.
- There is actually a fair bit of effort to make the above statement true. I don't disrespect the premise of this.
- However, local police departments do not receive any of these sustained burst photos. We're talking like 50 pictures or more at once, and Verra Mobility has no method of notifying the local authorities.
- Verra Mobility's photos must be validated by local police departments, but because they receive none of these photos, they were wholly unaware of the problem.
- In the span of 36 hours, I spoke about this phenomenon to locals in Fort Collins, including a 911-adjacent enterprise who instantly knew what I was talking about. This surprised me, having failed to find any knowledge at the local courthouse when searching for documents, or at the police department.
- My contact at the courthouse traffic camera group instructed me to contact Verra Mobility.
- One does not simply contact Verra Mobility.
- I tried brute forcing their extension directory for a while and I am left wondering about how many people or foreign names may be present in this secret directory. (I suspect their system is so autopilot that they don't even know I did this.)
- I sped through one of the other cameras to prove it works when it wants to.
- Upon recontacting my courthouse guy, I explained that I need a new contact because Verra Mobility is fundamentally unavailable to the public.
- I instigated Loveland's throwing the "breaker" on their Verra Mobility traffic cameras for a few days.
- Traffic cameras were explained by my police contact to be suffering from (spontaneous, situational, temporary) "drift" wherein they read the wrong lane's red light status and start hosing us with fraudulent photo triggers.
- I don't believe the "drift" story at all. At all. I have tried, but it does not wholly agree with what I have seen on these multiple occasions. It is a _plausible_ explanation that gets rid of you.
- Combined with the promise that there are no tickets being issued from these shock and awe bursts, the "drift" argument is designed to make you forget that Verra Mobility is receiving arbitrary photos of license plate data, passenger occupancy in the vehicle, and more. (We will post acquired contract documentation that makes this clear.)
- The city must contact their Verra-supplied "Customer Success Manager" liaison to mess with the cameras, and that liaison must come in person to throw the magic breaker.
- Verra Mobility has a retention policy.
- Verra Mobility has a privacy policy.
- Verra Mobility has a fat stack of photos of vehicles that the police cannot view.
- Verra Mobility has not disclosed this "malfunction" despite being the only one positioned to report it to our police departments.
- Verra Mobility has undisclosed partners.

I believe Verra Mobility is capable of identifying vehicles and "likely" occupant (by default: the registered owner, which is the data they affirmatively supply by virtue of their national databasing) and that they are capable of disclosing this information to any government entity which demands it. Without oversight, our own local police force never has disclosure.

I believe that Verra Mobility may be acting outside the boundaries of their contract with Loveland, and separate contract with Fort Collins, and that no one is reporting it, in any direction.

I believe I may be the only person reporting this to the city of Loveland. Verra Mobility's cameras at three intersections were taken offline on about Tuesday October 28, the day of my request for a police contact.

### Next

- I am preparing a Colorado Privacy Act letter for Verra Mobility, to discover who they disclose my information to.
- I am arranging to have the letter delivered directly to their headquarters in Mesa, Arizona.
- I am seeking a local at or around Mesa or Phoenix generally, who can go there with me on an open phone line while they deliver my questions.
- I am requesting the Loveland contract with Verra Mobility, and I intend to discover the company's liaison contact.
- I already possess the Fort Collins contract with Verra Mobility.
- The liaison names may be useful for a phone extension lookup, but I doubt it. I believe the Mesa HQ phone line is staffed by people with secret names and that it knowingly designed for that characteristic.
- I am seeking Fort Collins residents with experience witnessing these burst shots. I am beginning to realize that a lot of people might qualify as witnesses, but have not realized they are empowered to report it, and that their city might just take them offline like in Loveland.
