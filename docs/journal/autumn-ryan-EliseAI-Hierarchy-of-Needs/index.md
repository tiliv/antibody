"Minna Song is the co-founder and CEO of EliseAI,
a company using advanced natural language processing"

"to automate communication"

"across the multifamily industry—
and beyond"

"Originally launched as 'Meet Elise'
the company powers AI leasing agents for over 350 customers
including 70% of the 50 largest rental housing operators in the U.S."

"rental housing operators in the U.S."

"but Song’s vision goes far beyond leasing"

"she thinks real estate is finally waking up
to first-principles product design"

"That is, more multifamily operators are taking tasks
that have historically been completed by team members on-site,
moving them off-site to centralized offices, whether here, Or Offshore"

“What are our thinking (sic) about the hierarchy of needs, right?”
"How can we maximize our impact in this world?"
“It's food, water, and shelter. And so we picked shelter.”

"Brad Hargreaves: Is the AI pounding on the door saying, 'You gotta pay?'"
"Minna Song: It is, which is a great task."

"I think AI and centralization go hand in hand"

"So a lot more people are starting to adopt this autopilot model of operations"
