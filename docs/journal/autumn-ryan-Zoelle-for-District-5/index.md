This is not a private event. I am taking notes to discover what is going wrong with current races and what impact these groups believe they have and what they believe the gap is.

- the failed emulation of Zohran Mamdani
- door knocking resulted in "I don't vote" or related
- They wind up trying to sell on the doorstep but it's all a veneer
- Made a connection to their canvasers
- it seems to me that they are just selling DSA with a new skin face each time
- The candidate is canadian and has one of the most anemic topical site
  - to be fair, the opponent barely says anything either
- They know the other candidate was a nobody, but they had connections
- One Main Street
  - "Our Wario" (the anti-501c4, in DSA's words)
  - Did flyers for Tricia Canonico, tried to peg Emily Francis
- Seems like they want to pick issues instead of picking solutions
- They fundamentally missed the CSU angle (?? what? how?)
- They want to get away from sensationalist labels like Dark Money
  - They say they want to describe it more as the entrenched interests
- Self identitying people out there based on anti-trump. defining people by their enemies
- They are republican-phobic. They're meming.
- Field ops are the seen as the reason they were failing

- they're struggling to build a Universe, to query for their targets
- I'm realizing that the pervasive thing going on this room is learning how to campaign, not learning how to win with a candidate

- they want to campaign much earlier
  - i'm wondering. can they canvas without a campaign?
  - Can They Look For A Candidate Instead?
