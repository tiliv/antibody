#### Vergent Products

Sponsoring assistance for this event. They are local.

I'm glad a long-lived company like this exists here, but they know that networking is complicated and must be forcefully pushed out because people don't know that they're here.

As I listen tonight, I will be thinking about how people are bad at marketing by default. We except people to just show up, and I think we all know that's not how anything works. We trust the universe and the fruits of our labor. It seems merits aren't enough.

### The Panel

Some of this discussion will be about introductions and backgrounds. My interest is not in the technical vomit of documenting them, but I will try to highlight what they're doing that is unique and bespoke.

I will not show their job titles, because that information is available at the RE link. In addition, I won't feel compelled to write about how they agree with me unless it is an under-represented

- AI is the next information revolution.
- The tool and the murder weapon. (It's a CLUE joke.)
- Leveraging data
- Start from treating AI Output as a Failure Mode
- Data Governance is the New Architecture
  1. Quality
  2. Lineage
  3. Structure
  4. Foundation Data

#### (Sid) Siddharth Suryanarayanan

- This is a government programs engineer, with a focus on infrastructure
- He says that they don't market themselves well but that they are everywhere
  - It seems government groups enjoy an easy of effective secrecy. Even when the secrecy isn't really the goal (he's talking about it in public, after all) it seems government has a marketing hack.
- Data center cooling, solid state transformers
- Defense customers, TRL6, TRL7
  - He's talking about [://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/), technological readiness.
  - TRL6 is a prototype
  - TLR7 is an implementation (and not the top of the scale)
