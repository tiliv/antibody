This piece will examine the failures of democracy as deployed in the United States, whichever adjectival equivocation of its description that we use.

**We have committed to methods that have the effect** of ensuring small majorities (for certain definitions of majority) can conjure malice on their ideological opponents, and it did not start in 2016.

**Capitalist democracies have functioned well** under conditions that ensure a land of opportunity. We are allowed to debate the methods, but we are not doing that; We have all come to believe in Two Americas, though we divide them in our different ways. Us and Them. We act out competition for something scarce or even zero-sum.

**Our single-colored ideologies can no longer rationalize** their political stories without villains, loyalties and anti-loyalties. They Hold Up A Meme of themselves and want us to recognize it as leadership. They keep holding it up, and the voters don't come unless it is juiced by national debate.

**Lost for what to do, Two Americas await new preachers** who channel the spirit of patriotism that they recognize. The right memes have not risen up for the pedestrian population to locate their ideology. Their attention is drawn to the Unitary Executive, the oxygen leaving local races without centralized party commentary.

**When we don't have our preachers** we still listen to learn from the ones we have cause to fear. Missing our own leaders, we can learn at least what we disagree with and plan accordingly. It is not enough. In times when an Executive executes a premeditated a vision and doles that out in heavy measures, the paralysis is costly. The blitzkrieg works because it takes place on a field where no resistance is met.

**Listening is not action.** Listening we do very well, and we have amassed rational reasons. Some feel powerful and some feel powerless. Were the subjects of our debate so much more mundane, like a border policy, we could ascribe to eccentricity the loud voices of individuals. We have learned that loud voices are not all prophets, and some of us learn that none are at all.

**The transmission of mistrust** from outlets to out-groups (Them) is a bad method facilitated by bad memes held up to act like targets for social media. Public social shame is the only method of feedback available to a society that cannot speak to its People and Offices. And it is nonstop, it will not end because when color guards change, the other half of the country gets the roasting microphone.

**People have accepted that tuning out critique** is a viable method of living, when your personal Them is not reasonable, a hater, in error beyond helping. We do not arrive at consensus when our coalitions are packed into celebrity personalities. It is true that no single representative can represent everyone they should, but nor can anyone do it within their own party.

**The banners of Left politics seem ungroupable** as they are now. The current populist deployment of Right politics also seems ungroupable, yet has grouped anyway. Right-banners say that government philosophies must run faster now and have few rules; They are buying stock in volatility, allowing it to be crazy at smaller timescales if the proof of work comes out the other end. Left-banners say the tools of the office must not be touched at all because of the implication; They are not buying stock in anything, but battening down hatches for an ignorance con.

**Gavin Newsom, having some of the crazy** necessary to act out with some of the People's voice, will immediately drag the ghosts of California faith and anti-faith. We will see politics as before, and Newsom is the perfect heel to America First politics, should Newsom lose. His demise would be cheered based on mythology alone, as would his ascension's.

**Someone new, being the same in victory and defeat** is necessary for acting out more of the People's voice. Colors are not viable answers. Those memes have failed. Those institutions are fallen by capture or rust. Two parties are afraid to take new names, because they have not finished consolidating. Red has only named powers that lawyers at the Heritage Foundation imagine. Left has only named their nightmares.

**We complain about this Unitary Executive** in particular, but the damage is deeper, and your color alignment might not have prepared you to hear it.
