### R-Rated

My disassociation with GOP ideas did not need the help of a captured university, or a poisoned teacher, a bad school district, the wrong friends somewhere (the worst of whichever good echelon you fall from in someone's eyes). I grew up with Religion in a tense combat pose with the Government, the ancient pre-existing human condition of guarding what you have, against this one specific thing called The Government.

My disassociation with my childhood home came with knowing that I would learn a lot elsewhere and not feel as threatened as I'd seen others get as a rule. I didn't think our home encountered enough diversity of thought, but having recommendations is not easy, needing to speak well, for one thing.

I would not need to name a religion I came from, but it is so openly distinct, and it taught me such specific things, and they are not incidental things. The Latter-Day Saints—so that I name it once—are a varied people, and produce a lot of enterprises, not all affiliated, but often on the affiliated physical outlet shelves. The ecosystem of LDS music was so healthy that a Scattergories quiz would be far too easy. I cannot go on short enough.

Our family rented pirate edits of films from CleanFlix and I felt the defeat in their hearts the day they got the news it was a wholly illegal enterprise against the monetization of others' copyrights. I have never felt extreme about piracy, but I do get it. When you can't buy what you want, you splice tape like Liddy's on lookout.

There is holy ground beneath wherever they plant their feet, because that attitude was definitely necessary for an early US History adherent of that specific Faith. Today, that holy ground can appear under any loose corpo-dressed America business-shaven short hair man, when needed. If he has too much stubble don't correct him, he's already been corrected recently and hasn't been able to act on it yet. Instead, feel catty satisfaction that there is something to gossip later.

Churches deflect most trouble by telling us Men are fallible creatures even in their most devout service rendered, and are not always perfect instruments in His hands. Churches can assert a Qualified Immunity and a right to continue ministry, others eject the imperfect for appearances. The likelihood depends on the suspects.

**Authority is preserved by putting down its questioners.** This, above all. `Anti-s` is a slang mass noun that means those who are disgruntled ex employees, the reasons aux choix.

For those who couldn't know, The Book of Mormon stories teach that sometimes peoples wear the Anti label proudly when the Lord's chosen people were fallen, in full prophetic knowledge which let them be so self-satisfied. A prophet's mirth for "the names of the good guys and bad guys are backwards".

Stick to the manual if you don't know what to say, please.

**Confederate Allegiance is still yearned for.** Some are prepared to raise an `Anti` banner `against "America"`. By games with words, they can spin Anti good or bad. The quotation marks are the important part, `the mockery with air-quotes is working as intended`. The thesis available to the Unitary Executive is simple: It can doubt you out of existence, no matter your documentation. `The Rules Are Different Now.` The way before was in error for all of your life—why haven't you read this religious pamphlet about what's going on? If you need thaaat, you might need this other one too about Repentance.

**To win, you must put down the questioner as unhappy.** This standard issue opener ensures that nothing the Anti says has merit at all, full stop. Full Stop. Satan can make almost-clever Men say many things, so the Anti is tainted by this; The Anti's very need to sate curiosity is ungodly and will definitely lead them to invite wrong questions from the `Other Anti-s`; The whole affair is an expression of missing faith.

**When others fall away, Do Not Socialize With Them.** The instruction is never as explicit as it is, because the culture says it for them: Others are tainted and unwhole. Their Covenants are endangered now.

**Some Faithful perceive that playing at the edges of certainty** and uncertainty is a premeditated folly and a prior weakness of faith. There Is Enough in whichever "good book" so Do Not Look Further. The wholehearted must only understand what they haven't managed to yet, with existing materials and the most powerful prayers they know. For everyone else, they must not be meeting expectations Or This Wouldn't Be Happening. If You Listen, You Are Already Doing Everything Right. Just Give It Time.

**"Giving it time" was precisely what `MAGA` made a success condition**, instead of yours. The Unitary Executive moves quickly because it has a spellbook of Lawfare prepared by The Heritage Foundation, far more than we get the privilege of knowing until it's deployed. The Unitary Executive has weaponized legal `Privilege` without recourse, using lawyers for task dispatchers. The time has passed, and they got what they needed time for. The quality of lawyers available to the Unitary Executive has increased now; as before, it has used time well against other measures of worth.

**In this same time, `The Executive` Thwarted All Verdicts** by only asserting that `lawsuits were not allowed`, and that `the time for those had passed`. He no longer took questions about his claims back then, that the time for it was indeed `Now.` This Lawfare switch is the whole conclusion to the trick he started at the time you cite. He can make you go away just by not talking to you, and he knows you'll forget because he's capable of making sure with the list of things `his Government In Waiting prepared`. They know `Liberals are Weak. They won't do anything.` The zone is flooding, so that you do nothing even while you do a tiny something.

**They defined your too-big heart as a problem, and a way to control you indirectly.** You may be picking up toys while the angry adults do undescribable things out of focus. You won't know what they're doing while you toil. They don't care about the toys, but they know you do, and they're using it against you.

**The wind-driven Terms and Conditions placed upon the United States by a Unitary Executive** make certain that `No American Dream` is possible `but His`. The mantle of power sought after enables that which was `Prepared by God for the Wise Leadership of His People`. He can go that far. He can go further `by contemplating it while you ignored Him`. His `retribution` will be `like God The Father's`. `He is God.` *`Did you think I called Donald Trump a pronoun?`*

**The mass and sudden `conversion of the Wicked` is anticipated already.** Many false prophets believe they hold God's Original Authority, and the Unitary Executive listens with interest for novel ideas of worth. He gathered those most distant to you, `your "Others"` whom you provided no decency in policy or manners. The Executive was listening. The Executive made choirs for them, and they called Donald John Trump `a Prophet`.

**He has His People, and He forgives eagerly if you cross to His side.** The Unitary Executive threatens domestic military deployment the way Putin talks nuclear strike possibilities, except `Trump is better. He makes good.`

**It does not matter if they are hypocrites,** you must stop failing to charge down defenses, on the mass hallucination assumption that Someone Else can step in `who does the Rules or whatever`. Cultural Lefts walked all over the board just being gaudy, and they call it `your blitzkrieg, yours first`.

**That do-nothing "Biden" administration? That's what they call Your Blitzkrieg.** It is not connected to reality, and getting stuck on that point is what they want you to do. They know you will bite down on it and say It Should Have Ended There. It doesn't matter if you're "right", it truly does not matter. They are confusing you until it doesn't matter what you think, until it physically doesn't matter. `Might Makes Right.` The express wish of some to revoke choice altogether, diversity of thought altogether, is common and it is breeding when it parades unchallenged.

**Fox News Entertainment spent decades calling** `You Un-American.` They said You were part of a `War on Christmas` and you've not heard half of what Prager U says you'd do to a God-fearing Christian `if YOU had the guns`. When ANTIFA coverage appears, hosts scoffed and wondered if `they were just Anti-America, because This Is What America Looks Like`. It's their version of `"U-Mad?"` Do you hate America or something?

**Every prior loud complaint** about `shoving Your R-Rated Culture in their faces`, which you laughed at, is counted to be repaid. `You didn't believe your debtor when you had the chance.` They were not joking with you. They weren't being unreasonable before, like you claim, and they never were affected by the accusation in the intervening time either, despite `your self-satisfaction for a social media heart`. You just didn't understand `it could happen to you.` Bumping your head on the way in the door is the best case scenario. Eventually, like raising so many children, `The Unitiary Executive will lose interest in spectating the particulars of each.` They'll be told to do them quickly. God allows for dirty works, if it's in His name.

#### Expedient

**Taught before that "people will say anything", I can indeed confirm** that People really will say anything. We are rationalization engines by design. Happiness fits better when the terms were rationalized by you personally. We rationalize by nature, and so You Should Expect It And Not Listen. It is the flimsy say-nothing defense of arguments that don't matter. Falling for the details of their Rationalization is the proximate point of them raising it. They can put complex debate to bed with a verse Held Up As A Meme. The given one is an excuse provided in full Faith of the Original, which they will not be able to explain. They are imperfect, they're just telling you that God's coming. It's not their fault when you're Unhappy.

**"You're just angry" is not good enough for turning someone away** with a `You Have Your Answer.` Haters gonna `hate it if I take their Country from them` for a theological layup. If Those taking heart in `your eventual demise`, if giving that time is a good idea to you, you might have your head in the sand.

**Mass digital socialization has diversified our thoughts much faster** than most basically conservative People expected. Our cultural Lefts certainly know it: Hurry Up And Change For Us. Culture is supposed to change as fast as the rules say so, written or scrawled with sloppy precedent. Don't You Dare Unshake The Boat.

**A Mormon could read the "R-Rated" heading moniker** and turn away promptly without reading a word, and take no thought in going on to describe what it "looks like" as though they have Qualified Immunity for what they whisper next. Their Job Is To Do Damage To You. Your credibility must not ever appear correct, so that it doesn't matter what you use your mouth to say. We see this in attacks on academics of all kinds, no matter how practical their industries are. They want to read the labels and know it's safe. They want a Disney movie that doesn't have A Gay, or Two Gays (which is literally worse).

**Content-averse adults are not satisfied for labels.** They resent that it is on offer at all, as though PornHub is operating a physical store on their neighborhood corner. The more prudish they are, the more they know it's because they are tempted too and the absolutism is exactly what Chastity is all about. They want to predict perfectly well without looking, by the label, and they don't want to see labels they have to skip past. Their CleanFlix Culture is being proposed as a replacement for yours, and they brought the scissors and tape. It is absurd, but it fits elegantly that God's People would be the type to do so. Their Culture is being prescribed in place of `your missing Patriotism`. Fox New Entertainment told them you have no Patriotism anyway. None.

**Seeing something they don't like, they can presume no value inside.** They don't have to look because They Just Don't Have To. Merely having that Pride flag up represents the capture of public discourse, exactly as you'd say a Bag Guys faction's does. We all have tolerance for solidarity with additional flags, but when a flag's faction thinks it can grow and expand like a gas in an America-shaped chamber, we don't like any foothold. Lefts prefer the banners of solidarity with almost voiceless factions, self-selected medals with a story. America First may hold up a police banner to show citizen authorization of police making proactive moves against People, Un-American in their unimpressive way.

**You Are Not Exceptional Enough,** and now your time for trying has passed. That season of screed before now, that was back when they had tolerance to spare.

**The power of Prediction is taught ad nauseam** in simple tales in kinds of religious merchandise, which all make it plain and digestible for your cutest little niece how this or that People perished Because They Were Asking For It With Their Behavior.

**In some Cultures, this peddles as first-effort defense** for unhappiness, rape, gun violence, panic defenses, extra-judicial outcomes for `the prurient`, indifference to suffering, and more still, their own ideas of High Crimes if God calls on it, sure as Isaac almost died for Sacrifice `should He ask`.

**`America` belongs to Them.** It is the only `Promised Land for WASPs`. All other religions quietly know their rank in this pride:
1. A populist Christianity must finally claim the Land, and that this is latent and intended, like the demise of Roe, and other targets that the Heritage Foundation prepares and some Opinions of the Court court.
2. All other religions know that If We Take It, you will know They deserved to have it all along. They said as much. To convert is to accept all doctrine, please keep reading the manual for the part on Repentance.
3. You Are An Interloper On Their Land.
4. You Must Follow Higher Law For A Better Society.
5. God Has Pre-Authorized Taking Back What Is Owed.
6. They Want The Word `Pride` Back, just jot that down.

**It is never a good time** for hard-hearted beings to receive correction. Some who are disillusioned with Religion think many of these visible Faithful fail basic tests of Christ-like qualities. It's concerning. The fortress trucks drive around and their intent is not wholly clear. I can't read their labels either. When some say "natural" but mean explicitly unnatural things, I have to think deeper for myself about whether I'm locating any common ground at all while trying.

**`BREAKING 🚨🚨🚨`** BoTh SiDeS agree: It's hard to tell `when being an Anti is right`.

The Authority you seek isn't here. It's in another castle. The castle is a metaphor for work.
