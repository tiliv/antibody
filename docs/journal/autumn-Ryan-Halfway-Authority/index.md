### R-Rated

My disassociation with GOP ideas did not need the help of a captured university, or a poisoned teacher, a bad school district, the wrong friends somewhere (the worst of whichever good echelon you fall from in someone's eyes). I grew up with Religion in a tense combat pose with the Government, the ancient pre-existing human condition of guarding what you have, against this one specific thing called The Government.

My disassociation with my childhood home came with knowing that I would learn a lot elsewhere and not feel as threatened as I'd seen others get as a rule. I didn't think our home encountered enough diversity of thought, but having recommendations is not easy, needing to speak well, for one thing.

I would not need to name a religion I came from, but it is so openly distinct, and it taught me such specific things, and they are not incidental things. The Latter-Day Saints—so that I name it once—are a varied people, and produce a lot of enterprises, not all affiliated, but often on the affiliated physical outlet shelves. The ecosystem of LDS music was so healthy that a Scattergories quiz would be far too easy. I cannot go on short enough.

Our family rented pirate edits of films from CleanFlix and I felt the defeat in their hearts the day they got the news it was a wholly illegal enterprise against the monetization of others' copyrights. I have never felt extreme about piracy, but I do get it. When you can't buy what you want, you splice tape like Liddy's on lookout.

There is holy ground beneath wherever they plant their feet, because that attitude was definitely necessary for an early US History adherent of that specific Faith. Today, that holy ground can appear under any loose corpo-dressed America business-shaven short hair man, when needed. If he has too much stubble don't correct him, he's already been corrected recently and hasn't been able to act on it yet. Instead, feel catty satisfaction that there is something to gossip later.

Churches deflect most trouble by telling us Men are fallible creatures even in their most devout service rendered, and are not always perfect instruments in His hands. Churches can assert a Qualified Immunity and a right to continue ministry, others eject the imperfect for appearances. The likelihood depends on the suspects.

**Authority is preserved by putting down its questioners.** This, above all. `Anti-s` is a slang mass noun that means those who are disgruntled ex employees, the reasons aux choix.

For those who couldn't know, The Book of Mormon stories teach that sometimes peoples wear the Anti label proudly when the Lord's chosen people were fallen, in full prophetic knowledge which let them be so self-satisfied. A prophet's mirth for "the names of the good guys and bad guys are backwards".

Stick to the manual if you don't know what to say, please.

**Confederate Allegiance is still yearned for.** Some are prepared to raise an `Anti` banner `against "America"`. By games with words, they can spin Anti good or bad. The quotation marks are the important part, `the mockery with air-quotes is working as intended`. The thesis available to the Unitary Executive is simple: It can doubt you out of existence, no matter your documentation. `The Rules Are Different Now.` The way before was in error for all of your life—why haven't you read this religious pamphlet about what's going on? If you need thaaat, you might need this other one too about Repentance.

**To win, you must put down the questioner as unhappy.** This standard issue opener ensures that nothing the Anti says has merit at all, full stop. Full Stop. Satan can make almost-clever Men say many things, so the Anti is tainted by this; The Anti's very need to sate curiosity is ungodly and will definitely lead them to invite wrong questions from the `Other Anti-s`; The whole affair is an expression of missing faith.

**When others fall away, Do Not Socialize With Them.** The instruction is never as explicit as it is, because the culture says it for them: Others are tainted and unwhole. Their Covenants are endangered now.

**Some Faithful perceive that playing at the edges of certainty** and uncertainty is a premeditated folly and a prior weakness of faith. There Is Enough in whichever "good book" so Do Not Look Further. The wholehearted must only understand what they haven't managed to yet, with existing materials and the most powerful prayers they know. For everyone else, they must not be meeting expectations Or This Wouldn't Be Happening. If You Listen, You Are Already Doing Everything Right. Just Give It Time.

**"Giving it time" was precisely what `MAGA` made a success condition**, instead of yours. The Unitary Executive moves quickly because it has a spellbook of Lawfare prepared by The Heritage Foundation, far more than we get the privilege of knowing until it's deployed. The Unitary Executive has weaponized legal `Privilege` without recourse, using lawyers for task dispatchers. The time has passed, and they got what they needed time for. The quality of lawyers available to the Unitary Executive has increased now; as before, it has used time well against other measures of worth.

**In this same time, `The Executive` Thwarted All Verdicts** by only asserting that `lawsuits were not allowed`, and that `the time for those had passed`. He no longer took questions about his claims back then, that the time for it was indeed `Now.` This Lawfare switch is the whole conclusion to the trick he started at the time you cite. He can make you go away just by not talking to you, and he knows you'll forget because he's capable of making sure with the list of things `his Government In Waiting prepared`. They know `Liberals are Weak. They won't do anything.` The zone is flooding, so that you do nothing even while you do a tiny something.

**They defined your too-big heart as a problem, and a way to control you indirectly.** You may be picking up toys while the angry adults do undescribable things out of focus. You won't know what they're doing while you toil. They don't care about the toys, but they know you do, and they're using it against you.

**The wind-driven Terms and Conditions placed upon the United States by a Unitary Executive** make certain that `No American Dream` is possible `but His`. The mantle of power sought after enables that which was `Prepared by God for the Wise Leadership of His People`. He can go that far. He can go further `by contemplating it while you ignored Him`. His `retribution` will be `like God The Father's`. `He is God.` *`Did you think I called Donald Trump a pronoun?`*

**The mass and sudden `conversion of the Wicked` is anticipated already.** Many false prophets believe they hold God's Original Authority, and the Unitary Executive listens with interest for novel ideas of worth. He gathered those most distant to you, `your "Others"` whom you provided no decency in policy or manners. The Executive was listening. The Executive made choirs for them, and they called Donald John Trump `a Prophet`.

**He has His People, and He forgives eagerly if you cross to His side.** The Unitary Executive threatens domestic military deployment the way Putin talks nuclear strike possibilities, except `Trump is better. He makes good.`

**It does not matter if they are hypocrites,** you must stop failing to charge down defenses, on the mass hallucination assumption that Someone Else can step in `who does the Rules or whatever`. Cultural Lefts walked all over the board just being gaudy, and they call it `your blitzkrieg, yours first`.

**That do-nothing "Biden" administration? That's what they call Your Blitzkrieg.** It is not connected to reality, and getting stuck on that point is what they want you to do. They know you will bite down on it and say It Should Have Ended There. It doesn't matter if you're "right", it truly does not matter. They are confusing you until it doesn't matter what you think, until it physically doesn't matter. `Might Makes Right.` The express wish of some to revoke choice altogether, diversity of thought altogether, is common and it is breeding when it parades unchallenged.

**Fox News Entertainment spent decades calling** `You Un-American.` They said You were part of a `War on Christmas` and you've not heard half of what Prager U says you'd do to a God-fearing Christian `if YOU had the guns`. When ANTIFA coverage appears, hosts everywhere scoffed and wondered aloud if `they were just Anti-America, because This Is What America Looks Like`. It's their version of `"U-Mad?"` Do you hate America or something?

**Every prior loud complaint** about `shoving Your R-Rated Culture in their faces`, which you laughed at, is counted to be repaid. `You didn't believe your debtor when you had the chance.` They were not joking with you. They weren't being unreasonable before, like you claim, and they never were affected by the accusation in the intervening time either, despite `your self-satisfaction for a social media heart`. You just didn't understand `it could happen to you.` Bumping your head on the way in the door is the best case scenario. Eventually, like raising so many children, `The Unitiary Executive will lose interest in spectating the particulars of each.` They'll be told to do them quickly. God allows for dirty works, if it's in His name (NOT an autopen).

#### Expedient

**Taught before that "people will say anything", I can indeed confirm** that People really will say anything. We are rationalization engines by design. Happiness fits better when the terms were rationalized by you personally. We rationalize by nature, and so You Should Expect It And Not Listen. It is the flimsy say-nothing defense of arguments that don't matter. Falling for the details of their Rationalization is the proximate point of them raising it. They can put complex debate to bed with a verse Held Up As A Meme. The given one is an excuse provided in full Faith of the Original, which they will not be able to explain. They are imperfect, they're just telling you that God's coming. It's not their fault when you're Unhappy.

**"You're just angry" is not good enough for turning someone away** with a `You Have Your Answer.` Haters gonna `hate it if I take their Country from them` for a theological layup. If Those taking heart in `your eventual demise`, if giving that time is a good idea to you, you might have your head in the sand.

**Mass digital socialization has diversified our thoughts much faster** than most basically conservative People expected. Our cultural Lefts certainly know it: Hurry Up And Change For Us. Culture is supposed to change as fast as the rules say so, written or scrawled with sloppy precedent. Don't You Dare Unshake The Boat.

**A Mormon could read the "R-Rated" heading moniker** and turn away promptly without reading a word, and take no thought in going on to describe what it "looks like" as though they have Qualified Immunity for what they whisper next. Their Job Is To Do Damage To You. Your credibility must not ever appear correct, so that it doesn't matter what you use your mouth to say. We see this in attacks on academics of all kinds, no matter how practical their industries are. They want to read the labels and know it's safe. They want a Disney movie that doesn't have A Gay, or Two Gays (which is literally worse).

**Content-averse adults are not satisfied for labels.** They resent that it is on offer at all, as though PornHub is operating a physical store on their neighborhood corner. The more prudish they are, the more they know it's because they are tempted too and the absolutism is exactly what Chastity is all about. They want to predict perfectly well without looking, by the label, and they don't want to see labels they have to skip past. Their CleanFlix Culture is being proposed as a replacement for yours, and they brought the scissors and tape. It is absurd, but it fits elegantly that God's People would be the type to do so. Their Culture is being prescribed in place of `your missing Patriotism`. Fox New Entertainment told them you have no Patriotism anyway. None. The other outlets spawned in that wake and mince words less.

**Seeing something they don't like, they can presume no value inside.** They don't have to look because They Just Don't Have To. Merely having that Pride flag up represents the capture of public discourse, exactly as you'd say a Bad Guys faction's does. We all have tolerance for solidarity with additional flags, but when a flag's faction thinks it can grow and expand like a gas in an America-shaped chamber, we don't like any foothold. Lefts prefer the banners of solidarity with almost voiceless factions, self-selected medals with a story. America First may hold up a police banner to show citizen authorization of proactive police measures against People, Un-Americans in their unimpressive way.

**You Are Not Exceptional Enough,** and now your time for trying has passed. That season of screed before now, that was back when they had tolerance to spare.

**The power of Prediction is taught ad nauseam** in simple tales in kinds of religious merchandise, which all make it plain and digestible for your cutest little niece how this or that People perished Because They Were Asking For It With Their Behavior.

**In some Cultures, this peddles as first-effort defense** for unhappiness, rape, gun violence, panic defenses, extra-judicial outcomes for `the prurient`, indifference to suffering, and more still, their own ideas of High Crimes if God calls on it, sure as Isaac almost died for Sacrifice `should He ask`.

**`America` belongs to Them.** It is the only `Promised Land for WASPs`. All other religions quietly know their rank in this pride:
1. A populist Christianity must finally claim the Land, and that this is latent and intended, like the demise of Roe, and other targets that the Heritage Foundation prepares and some Opinions of the Court court.
2. All other religions know that If We Take It, you will know They deserved to have it all along. They said as much. To convert is to accept all doctrine, please keep reading the manual for the part on Repentance.
3. You Are An Interloper On Their Land.
4. You Must Follow Higher Law For A Better Society.
5. God Has Pre-Authorized Taking Back What Is Owed.
6. They Want The Word `Pride` Back, just jot that down.

**It is never a good time** for hard-hearted beings to receive correction. Some who are disillusioned with Religion think many of these visible Faithful fail basic tests of Christ-like qualities. It's concerning. The fortress trucks drive around and their intent is not wholly clear. I can't read their labels either. When some say "natural" but mean explicitly unnatural things, I have to think deeper for myself about whether I'm locating any common ground at all while trying.

**`BREAKING 🚨🚨🚨`** BoTh SiDeS agree: It's hard to tell `when being an Anti is right`.

The Authority you seek isn't here. It's in another castle. The castle is a metaphor for work.

### Two rules

#### Susie Wiles

For a long time I saw rules as the smooth, if contoured, floor that kept the game basically playable. Later, the negative-space of the same scene is more impressive: the rules can be climbed on.

While the Unitary Executive decries hooliganism writ large in the populace, corporations hang from our legal rafters, using cruel and think-fast tactics just because we gave them things to do it from.

Somehow businesses became "People" but with swappable brains; Are we confused why businesses like AI so much? These organizations all survive by climbing on the rules.

When there is one rule, it becomes two rules through the prism of observation: Avoid This; Skirt This.

When skirting makes them feel cornered instead of exalted atop an ever growing pile of rules (and a very ugly jungle gym), they get angry. They launder money as "Speech" and make our law say what it must. They default to their own Privacy in all situations, while they benefit from passive surveillance on us to exist as we do. Companies make economies, but please have some limits.

Were corporations our actual governments, some of the giantism tribes would seem mighty ripe for power struggles. Were our Chiefs not so implicitly immune to our feedback (the explicitly voiced troubles of People), we would have hope! But alas, companies are formed specifically to map this authoritarian method to somewhere it is suited, in free enterprise.

The need for Public infrastructure wasn't hard to notice early, but now we have a Unitary Executive risen from a shape-shifting corporate "Person" who wants to buy companies away from the stock market, turning the market into a slave pickup location. The Chiefest Person is looking for anyone desperately devout in their worship of Mammon, to work for his whims. You'll be told you'll be treated well, since your acquiescence (the predictable part) was step one in their aim.

There is a veritable body of Rules lying about us like so many forgotten sharp weapons. Do you have apostate lawyers searching for these like MAGA does? I prefer to treat their study of Lawfare relics as an obsession with mysticism: They will not require finesse with it when they set to work in earnest.

Today, the Unitary Executive, Chief of all, is not taking feedback, except through Susie Wiles and whichever friends are over. It's why Lefts boo at openly at any White Nationalist dinner guests. MAGA says this is just talk and that The Mind Virus spreads blame like butter without knowing anything—credibility can't be on Their side. You Were Not In The Room (By Design). Susie Wiles and others are (and sometimes not with Wiles).
- [://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles)

The Office's occupant was installed to not need any feedback.

We hesitate to control companies the way we're too afraid to go into Uvalde. Do we all secretly know what they're armed with and how bad it could go?

Is it up to God who survives a fight? Welcome to America, where In God We Trust since 1956 and for some centuries before.

It's all about God, it is in fact all about your Feelings. The Homeland must ultimately be His, Mormons in Missouri or not.

#### Tucker Carlson

It is first and foremost a shame that Tucker Carlson was the one capable of even pestering Netanyahu for an interview, to counter an Iranian interview, after a Putin interview, after leaving the basically-exonerated and rising Fox News family. Somehow nobody thinks he should be running back to Fox, because he's got something else and everyone sees the dynamic range.

As humans, it doesn't matter how weird or storied we are. History doesn't care where you came from, only what you made happen.

**Are you the kind of person who makes things happen _at all_?** The happening of things is what creates churn, change, and opportunity fresh and flowing. It's not even a Capitalism thing. We endeavor to texture our experience, by discovery or fabrication. Power throughout history is touched by those who made themselves be where it would be, and they put themselves to its work like a field. Value is not what you can resell on Etsy in your sleep, it is knowing that you personally have the wherewithal to try your hand on something you know has value.

Real work creates new value in a stale market, making possible entirely new comparisons for where more value may lie. The entire market gets fresh speculation, not caring if Tucker is right on the particulars. The worship of procedure is on display. It is an infinite art, alive as long as we are.

Tucker Carlson went international and though he started out broadcasting unmitigated Russian propaganda about how Americans should think of Russia, the Iranian interview was proof he had no plan to say anything specific, but was starting something. Netanyahu had already declined requests multiple times.

Some like DeSantis went international but didn't go as far without well-networked conventions near and far to inflate his aura. Some like Rubio now look a little crisped by Trump's energy but adapt quickly to requesting citizen detainment on foreign soils. There are others, like Lindsey Graham who dance when called on. Of the "journalists" especially, how is it that only Carlson is making original content that isn't just another rebroadcasting channel (This week's emergency episode sponsored by whatever.)

I want interviews with the Japanese, the French. I want to see our politicians fail to do more than filler and realize they're not varsity yet. And I want it like a coach wants to see improvement. I do want to see our People succeed on international issues, but I know they're going to flail for a while.

Geopolitically isolated in so many ways, our home is not diversified enough in its thoughts. The worst part of a Biden term was that we prepared nothing for a new answer, and nor did our journalists. They are all reacting, merging with the Authoritarian's aura, the natural shriek made by a forest when real danger is in fact coming. The shriek is the most satisfying sound you could make, because it communicates all the power in one single instant transmission: You believe you're already powerless.

I worry in earnest what Americans should do if foreign powers try to land here to intervene. America is its own Alcatraz, for those the Unitary Executive says are prisoner now. Imprisoned in America, there is no help coming, and we're suddenly funding ICE better than any prison system.

Never was it clearer when Biden's envoys abroad did nothing, and Trump's people did everything, that traditional backgrounds were still flimsy compared to grit. Blinken was wringing his hands and promising dinner soon while he knew it was on fire back there, and Carlson was talking with Iran on the web. Broadcasting Iran was not especially important a thing to do, but there was no way Carlson was going to do propaganda for them as such. He churned things, sue him.

There are numerous ways for Carlson to stay irrelevant to me, but there are moments he seems peerless. It feels more like a statement of such sparse contenders, how little it takes versus the entire corporatized body of trained "journalists".

#### Mind Virus

The Mind Virus is a church of humankind also founded in America like Protestants. Construed however, it has no universal priests. This is often missed on critics who want to challenge one champion by proxy.

Like a church, the Mind Virus expects its fellows to be ready to hear anything. This works well in many places where a different kind of rugged individualism shapes Millennials and others who lost their fear of Strangers along with the lights coming on all across our social media graphs and showing us that few were actually that scary. It was no longer viable for The News to broadcast into America's homes that their neighbors were putting drugs and razor blades in Trick Or Treat bags. We weren't that scary if we just talked.

But just talking didn't do the whole job. Pushing out the range of social borders, the Mind Virus found not everyone believed the same way in the shared doctrine. Indeed, even many religious have no qualms with the microscopic principles of Wokeness. Wokeness in a certain era could be mocked for attacking itself, but mockery is self-soothing behavior and to attack Wokeness you had to attack a wider way of being. Now the Wokeness was hiding in companies who had suspiciously not bent the knee to the Chief.

There must needs be a reason why more knees were not bent to the Chief. It was that pesky Mind Virus holding back even The Good Ones. Not believing that They should be allowed to have the Virus in secret either, Authority was necessary to expunge it and to prescribe what should be done instead. The prescription would not go down so easily were it not for the American flag wrapping the government doctor, and the label you should look no further than: Patriotism, label only the government doctor in particular could give. You don't get to pick this side, and they openly discuss what they want for their own Domestic Enemies.

All the while, the Faithful already believe in the coming weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, foretold by scripture.

The Mind Virus is a predictable large-network response to needing ponds of safety in a hostile-default environment that buzzes warnings when you have its attention for any reason. Soon, the preachers of groups found their individual voices weren't good enough, and simplified language was negotiated on social media with much infighting. You're Bad If You Don't Heart This.

Authoritarianism is a predictable large-network response to needing finer individual control. It deploys efficient systems to do this, applying its genius sustainably. Tony Stark came out of that cave resurrected three days later because He Knows More Than You. It's not just doing more with less. With a stronger mastery of base principles, more can be wrought than by pedestrians. Authoritarian rationalizations include long lists of explicit reasons and needs. The ideology is arriving because it was made possible by that list, and it already knows that you mock things on the list. They already know. That's why it's on the list.

This large patch of exposed ground on planet Earth "needs" neither philosophy. These are brought by People with motives, as are all things.

Companies are the perfect tinctures of authoritarianism, but then they said a CEO "should" be President, who "should" run the Country like a Business. They meant it in every way possible. Beholden to no one, equipped with fine powers over its self-guided dominion (Greenland and Canada too?), immune with anything it calls "official business", the terms can still update nightly when necessary.

When we reduce our great Constitution (and the amendments they remembered to add) and system of law into the one amorphous Rule, two rules appear and you can select which to use:
- Play where it's clear, and
- Climb on it.

There are deeper doctrines than those (Carve it.) which spring from mastery of these. The Mind Virus and its claimed antidotes are purity tests that identify Which Type You Are, whatever that is, and quickly. The Mind Virus's purported function is the fence of safety in spaces. Once in a culture where we had Privacy and could hide from the digital, we now have to clear physical spaces to find unbothered refuge. Conservatives knew all along about safe space, they just don't like it staked on public ground. And because it's so public, they can tell sometimes that coddling is worse than correction and they see too much coddling.

For the Authoritarian perpetrators wielding Religion in their off-hand, public ground can contain Bibles, Commandments and Icons. They proudly report their desire to capture truly more public space. They Are Owed This Now, they say. They wouldn't have done this had you simply not existed in public first, of course. Talk about Terms you heard about too late...

Their powers of prediction are so holy, that them not doing this sooner might be the real problem they see. Now they have so much work to show they were right all along.

Their All-Along America First vision is astonishingly inept in ways, but like Tucker Carlson, the churn makes opportunity for all. Forget the particulars. Look at what is creaking as a result of what they do, and make that stronger so that it withstands. Make it better.

There are no Authority figures coming to help. It is up to you, and when you weather and feel stronger, you'll understand Pride as MAGA does. They are a step ahead in their Authority, having acquired their powerful piece. They have defensively set in for decades in anticipation of these times.

Anti-Woke is backfilling its reservoirs of cultural grievances, and they haven't reached their Woke-like supersaturation. It will get louder.

### What is wrong?

#### Regulation
