#### Service Center
- First State Auto Group owns the Crossroads Hyundai location.
- In 2025, they possess a privacy policy that allows them generous capabilities with marketing. Unsurprisingly, we are signing things like this every day.
- I went to the dealership because of an outstanding service recall, and a check engine light. I did not feel that I had options.
- Within 30 minutes of my signature given, an AI agent purporting to be a human-named employee at Crossroads Hyundai solicited me for a "YES" so that the dealership could buy my car from me.
- The terms are not visible, requiring an "INFO" reply.
- The LLM agent replies instantly to non-Yes/No/Info replies with a second attempt to pressure for a "YES".
- Requesting employee information from the LLM caused it to go silent.
- Confronting a trio of three employees with the privacy policy, none could enumerate what the policy allowed for.
- Employees are trained to dodge the question of speaking with the named LLM "rep". It requires a second question to directly expose it as AI.
- Their privacy policy makes no mention of AI specifically, therefore I pressed to know what else they can do with the terms as defined by them. None could suggest anything more than "marketing".
- I left this interaction with the feedback that another _opportunity_ to consent to such a service would be an improvement.

#### Email to Service Center
- A few months later, I planned a subsequent visit to the dealership to follow up on work they had recommended in the previously documented visit.
- On a Friday, I submitted a web request to the Service Center. Not believing that I had a way to see the prior service log, I elected to use the web form to describe what I remembered about the work. I described my needed service incorrectly, and I knew this--I was presenting my errors for them to be corrected.
- Enjoying the opportunity to remind them who I was, I ended the note by requesting that I kindly not be put into an AI privacy nightmare again, because, as I recounted in a summary, an AI had tried to buy my car without anyone knowing.
- Two emails arrived on Monday morning: 1) A human salesman trying to buy my car, and 2) another LLM service bot who had been routed to my spam box two minutes later.
- The AI agent claimed the name "Ashley James" and used the personal pronoun "I" alongside the apparent job title of "Internet concierge".
- The AI agent repeated my broken description of what service I needed, verbatim. It asked in a kindly way to get started on it.
- My emails with it confirmed its LLM nature as quickly as the auto-reply.

#### Crossroads Hyundai, Day 1

- I called the dealership, only to find the phone ringing with no answer. It was not closing time, but it was near enough that I could imagine needing to ring them a few times if I wanted an explanation.
- Instead, the connection is dropped after a robot anounces that the voice mailbox is full.
- I called repeatedly while I drove to the location before closing time.
- When I asked what phone I was actively ringing in front of them, they did not know. They could not reveal or find out.
- I asked them my real question: Who is Ashley James.
- The employees do not know the term LLM, so I clarify in my request if it is an AI.
- Ashamed like the last batch, they admit it is.
- They have no knowledge of the conversation it had with me. There is no human QA at all.

#### Crossroads Hyundai, Day 2

- The morning of Tuesday, I arrived again to ask questions.
- They still had no knowledge of the conversation that I had with their supposed representative.
- I ask them if they can in fact access the log.
- He is able. I confirm this without looking at it myself by soliciting him to answer about the contents: he confirms I used vulgarities in my "conversation" with the unmonitored chat ai.
- When asked who names the bots, he reveals "Impel" as the operator of the service.
- I have notes about who authorizes this decision at Crossroads Hyundai. He was not in the state at the time of my visit. Nor was the human sales agent who I confirmed had a specific desk nearby with a second busy individual.
- The dealership is a multi-state operation which authorizes the use of the service known as "impel.ai".
- impel.ai features copious testimonalies that are universally doctored. They portray a telling clarification in each, in the vein of "I just love Amber (Sales AI)!"
- All promotional material for this service purports to label its sales assistants, but I do not know if they never actually label them, or if it is up to each dealership.
- However, the doctored labels hang a hat on why the label is needed: The service works so well specifically because the humans believe there is a human power agent who is magically not available to come out and say hello.
- Employee testimonials featured on impel.ai's materials also clearly indicate that they're so bummed they have to tell humans that their LLM hoax can't see them when they close on a deal.

_impel.ai has not returned requests for a product demo._

_Additional contact is being arranged._
