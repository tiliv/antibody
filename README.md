# Fort Collins Civic Node: ANTIBODY

This is an open-source publication of local-made journalism.

News media will waste our time; Their nutrition is secured through our attention, and our data. They have had it all, but cannot hear us.

We assert that there are degrees of information quality, that we must not struggle to distinguish them and that they are these:
1) First-party claims with metadata,
2) Hearsay and
3) Fraud.

It is necessary for our social cohesion that we possess various ways and means of direct information exchange within our cities. Our Domestic Enemies have taken our placation for granted, however We the People have acquired on our own several talents and skills to deploy in our defense.
